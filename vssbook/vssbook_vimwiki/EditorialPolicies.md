    - orthography: deviant orth, sandhi, punctuation?
    - avagrahas usually supplied but sometimes found in the MSS, not used by me for crasis (e.g. a+a=ā)
    - daṇḍas: usually 4 pādas to a verse, but I have made arbitrary decisions based on sense-units 
      because none of the sources really indicate where a verse ends (||).
    - falsifications everywhere on purpose and accidentally
