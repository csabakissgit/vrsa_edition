# Chapter One


1.1 Having bowed to [Him] whose boundaries are limitless,
who has no beginning, no middle part and no end,
[to Him] who is very subtle and who is the unmanifest and fine essence of the world,
[to Him] who is respected as the foremost by Hari, Indra, Brahmā and the other [gods],
I shall recite [the work called] `A Compendium on the Essence of the Bull [of Dharma]'.

NOTE:

    
    _Pāda_ a is reminiscent of, among other famous passages, Bhagavadgītā 11.19:
    <br/>
    _anādimadhyāntam anantavīryam <br/>
    anantabāhuṃ śaśisūryanetram / <br/>
    paśyāmi tvāṃ dīptahutāśavaktraṃ <br/>
    svatejasā viśvam idaṃ tapantam //_ <br/>
    This faint reference to the Bhagavadgītā seems proper at the
    beginning of a work that claims to deliver a teaching
    based on, but also to surpass, the Mahābhārata (see following verses).
    See also e.g. Kūrmapurāṇa 1.11.237:<br/>
    _rūpaṃ tavośeṣakalāvihīnam [tavā? CHECK]<br/>
    agocaraṃ nirmalam ekarūpam / <br/>
    anādimadhyāntam anantām [anantam? CHECK] ādyaṃ  <br/>
    namāmi satyaṃ tamasaḥ parastāt_ // <br/>
    To say that a god has no beginning and no end in a temporal or spacial
    sense is natural (_anādi°...°antam_), but to have no `middle part'
    (_°madhya°_) in these senses is slightly less so.
    Thus the rather commonly occuring phrase _anādimadhyāntam_ is probably not
    much more than a fixed expression meaning `endless and/or eternal'.
    As to which god this stanza is referring to, it may be Śiva,
    his name not being listed among those who treat him as chief god,
    but the phrasing of the verse is vague enough to keep the question somewhat open:
    the impersonal Brahman might be another option, even more so if we
    look at 1.9--10, two verses nearby verses discussing _brahmavidyā_.
    
    

    In _pāda_ b _jagat-susāraṃ_ is most probably not
    to be interpreted as _jagatsu sāraṃ_.
    

    Strictly speaking, _pāda_ c is unmetrical, but it is better to
    simply acknowledge here the phenomenon of `muta cum liquida', namely
    that syllables followed by consonant clusters such as
    _ra, bra, hra, kra, śra, śya, śva, sva, dva_ can be treated as short.
    Thus _harīndrabrahmā°_ can be treated as a regular beginning
    of an _upajāti_ (. - . - -), the syllable
    _bra_ not turning the previous syllable long.
    

    The reading _āsamagraṃ_ in _pāda_ c is difficult to interpret.
    \msM\ gives an exciting alternative (_yat samagraṃ_), but
    it seems more like a guess to me than the correct reading.
    The most tempting of all the possible corrections I have considered
    (_arcyam/arhyam/arghyam/īḍyam agraṃ_)
    seemed to be _āptam agraṃ_, meaning `appointed/received/respected
    [by Hari, Indra, Brahmā etc.] as the foremost one'.
    The fact that the _akṣara_s _āsam_ and _āptam_ look similar
    in most of the scripts used in our manuscripts supports this
    conjecture.
    

    Note how we could percieve the end of _pāda_s a and b,
    as well as _pāda_s c and d as rhymes.
    

    Is pāda d hypermetrical? It is actually a _vaṃśastha_ (_triṣṭubh - jagatī_ change).
    See Apte App. A p. 4.
     


1.2 Having listened to the Bhāratasaṃhitā [i.e. the Mahābhārata], the supreme book of
a hundred thousand [verses], a thousand chapters (_adhyāya_)
with all its hundred sections (_parvan_),

NOTE:

    
    The dialogue of Janamejaya and Vaiśampāyana make up the outermost layer of the VSS
    (except for the introductory stanzas 1.1-3), which mostly contains
    general _dharmaśāstric_ material.
    

    The hundred _parvan_s of the Mahābhārata are listed in MBh 1.2.33--70. 


1.3 Janamejaya remained unsatisfied and what he asked Vaiśampāyana
in the past, listen to that unweariedly.

NOTE:

    
    For a similar unsatisfaction or dissatisfaction with previous
    teachings, see Niśvāsa mūla 1.9:
    

    <skt>vedāntaṃ viditaṃ deva sāṃkhyaṃ vai pañcaviṃśakam |
    na ca tṛptiṃ gamiṣyāmo hy ṛte śaivād anugrahāt ||</skt>
    

    and Śivadharmaśāstra... CHECK. 
    Vaiśampāyana, a ṛṣi, the disciple of Vyāsa, recited the Mahābhārata at the snake sacrifice of
    Janamejaya. CHECK SOURCE
    

    Note how we are forced to emend _pāda_ c to contain a stem form proper noun (_janamejaya_)
    to maintain the metre, and note how the manuscripts struggle with this _pāda_.
     


1.4 Janamejaya spoke:
O venerable sir, O knower of the entire Dharma, O you who are well-versed in all the
sciences (_śāstra_)!
Is there a supreme and secret Dharma which liberates [us] from the ocean of
mundane existence (_saṃsāra_)?

NOTE:

    
    Note _dharma_ as a neuter noun in _pāda_ c and in the next verse. 


1.5 Teach me the Dharma that emerged from [Vyāsa] Dvaipāyana's mouth, O best of Brahmins.
Help me find satisfaction at all cost, O great ascetic!


1.6 Vaiśampāyana spoke:
Listen with great attention, O king, to this unsurpassed narration of Dharma.
Hear the secret Dharma that I received by Vyāsa's favour.


1.7 -- 1.8 Viṣṇu, the great Lord, assuming the form of a Brahmin, wanted to
test the one who performed nonmaterial sacrifices,
the one who focused on his austerities and observances,
the one whose conduct was virtuous and pure, and who was intent on
compassion towards all living beings, and therefore he humbly asked him a question.

NOTE:

    
    The majority of the MSS consulted include a _vā_ in _pāda_ b,
    distinguishing between the `secret Dharma' mentioned in 1.4c and
    the one taught by Vyāsa. This may or may not be the better reading.
    The reading of \msM\ is tempting. CHECK.
    I decided to follow MS \msCb\ because I suspected that the two Dharmas
    hinted at are the same. 
    Note the odd syntax here: _viṣṇunā... dvijarūpadharo bhūtvā papraccha_.
    The agent of the active verb is in the instrumental case. 


1.9 [Vigatarāga spoke:]
How is the knowledge of Brahman to be understood if [this knowledge] is devoid of
[definitions of the] form and colour [of Brahman]?
[And] the syllable that is devoid of vowels and consonants:
is that [its] highest [form]?

NOTE:

    
    The translation of this verse, and the reconstruction and interpretation
    of _pāda_ d, which is echoed in 1.10d, is slightly tentative. 


1.10 Anarthayajña spoke:
That syllable is not to be pronounced, is unquestionable, non-dividable, consistent,
spotless, all-pervading and subtle: what could be higher than that?

NOTE:

    
    I interpret _pāda_ d, which is an echo of 1.9d, tentitvely as a compound,
    slightly differently from the way I did above. 


1.11 Vigatarāga spoke:
When the body disintegrates in the ground, in water, in fire or [is torn apart] by jackals
and other [animals],
how is the supportless and spotless soul led [to the netherworld] by Yama's messengers?


1.12 How is it bound by the nooses of death/time? And if it is bodiless, how can it move?
And how does the [soul of a] virtuous [person] (_bahudharmakṛt_)
reach heaven if it has no body?
Teach me about this doubtful matter (_saṃśaya_) that I am raising (_me_).
I want to know the truth about it.


1.13 Anarthayajña spoke:
You are asking me about an extremely doubtful
and problematic matter, O great Brahmin.
It is difficult to understand by humans, and [even] by gods (_deva_),
demons (_dānava_) and serpents (_pannaga_).


1.14 The cause of both the birth and death of the body is karma.
Good and bad deeds are called the two nooses.


1.15 [Man] goes to hell or heaven accordingly.
Happiness and suffering, both arising from karma, are to be experienced by the body.


1.16 O great Brahmin, the body is produced for humans for his reason.
Now learn about that which they call the noose of time,
I shall teach you, O you of great observances.


1.17 [If] you don't know anything, how could you start
your investigation, O Brahmin?
O Brahmin king, you should know the noose of time in its entirety.


1.18 Learn about time which is divided into digits (_kalā_), [i.e. about]
the division[s] (_kalā_) of the entity [called] Time (_kālatattva_).
Two atomic units of time (_truṭi_) is one twinkling (_nimeṣa_).
One digit (_kalā_) is twice a twinkling.

NOTE:

    
    The word _°śivā°_ in _pāda_ b is slightly suspect, and could be the result
    of metathesis, from _°viṣā°_ (`by poison'). Nevertheless,
    jackals seems appropriate in this context, for they
    are commonly associated with human corpses, death and the cremation ground.
    (see e.g. Ohnuma 2019)
    (Reiko Ohnuma 2019 = Ohnuma, R. The Heretical, Heterodox Howl:
    Jackals in Pāli Buddhist Literature. Religions 2019, 10, 221.) 
    The word _kāla_ has, as usual, a double meaning in this verse: a _kālapāśa_
    is both Yama's noose, and also the limitation caused by time,
    as becomes clear at the discussion
    on the different time units in verses 1.11--31. 
    The variant _jijñāsyasi_ seems to be the lectio difficilior as opposed to
    _vijñāsyasi_, but the latter could also work fine here. 
    1.18d and 1.19a are problematic in the light of 1.19b, which
    redefines _kalā_ in harmony with the traditional
    interpretaion, see e.g. Arthaśāstra 2.20.33: _trimśatkāṣṭhāḥ kalāḥ_. 


1.19 Two digits (_kalā_) form one bit (3.2 seconds; _kāṣṭhā_).
Thirty bits (_kāṣṭhā_) is one digit (1.6 minutes; _kalā_).
Thirty digits (_kalā_) make up one section (48 minutes; _muhūrta_)
according to mankind, O great Brahmin.


1.20 Thirty sections (_muhūrta_) are known to the
wise as night and day [i.e. a full day].
Thirty days and nights are taught by the wise ones to be one month.


1.21 One year is twelve months [according to] people who know the entity of time.
The time span of three hundred thousand plus sixty thousand years


1.22 by human standards is said to be the Kali era.
The Dvāpara era is known to be twice as long as the Kali era.

NOTE:

    
    Note the stem form noun _yuga_ metri causa. 


1.23 The Tretā era is thrice [as long], the Kṛta era four [times as long as the Kali].
This is [how to add up] the number[s] related to the Four Yugas [= a _mahāyuga_].
Taking [this length of four _yuga_s] seventy-one [times],

NOTE:

    
    The element _°yugā°_ seems to stand for °yuga° metri causa.
    If _°yugā_ and _saṃkhyā_ are to be separated, _eṣā_ becomes
    problematic to interpret. 


1.24 the knowledge about one time-span of Manu is being taught briefly
[i.e.\ 71 four-fold _mahāyuga_s make up a _manvantara_].
One Kalpa is fourteen _manvantara_s in total.


1.25 Brahmā's day is made up of ten thousand Kalpas.
[Brahmā's] night is of the same [length] according to the wise who know the truth.


1.26 When [Brahmā's] night falls, the whole moving and unmoving universe dissolves.
And when [his] daylight comes, the moving and unmoving [universe] is born.

NOTE:

    
    See 21.34ff. 
    The plural form _pralīyante_ in _pāda_ a is metri causa for _pralīyate_,
    perhaps also influencing _utpadyante_ (for _utpadyate_) in _pāda_ d,
    which in turn is used here to avoid an iambic pattern (- - . - . - . -). 


1.27 A _para_ times _parārdha_ [number of, i.e.
two hundred quadrillion times a hundred quadrillion] _kalpas_
have passed [so far], O great Brahmin.
Bhṛgu and the other sages say that the future is the same [time span].

NOTE:

    
    Note the peculiar compound _bhṛgu-r-ādi-maharṣayaḥ_. 


1.28 Just as the sun, the planets, the stars and the moon are percieved by us as wandering around,
the wheel of time (_kālacakra_) keeps spinning and we never experience its halting.


1.29 Time creates living beings and time destroys them again.
Everything is under the control of time. There is nothing that can bring time under control.


1.30 Fourteen _parārdha_s is [the number of] the kings of the gods [i.e. Indras?], O Brahmin,
who passed by over time, for time is difficult to overcome.

NOTE:

    
    Note that _samatītāni_ (neuter) most probably picks up _devarājāḥ_
    (masculine) in this verse, or rather _devarājā_ stands for
    _devarājānāṃ_ and _samatītāni_ picks up _°parārdhāni_. 


1.31 Time is [manifest] as a great yogin,
as Brahmā, Viṣṇu and supreme Śiva,
it is beginningless and endless, it is the creator,
the great soul. Pay homage [to Time].


1.32 Vigatarāga spoke:
I have just heard [the term] `wheel of time' (_kālacakra_) uttered from [your] lotus mouth,
as well as _parārdha_ and _para_. You have made these things appear as
exciting, as things to hear.

NOTE:

    
    The reading of all manuscripts consulted, _vinisṛtam_,
    may be considered metrical if we interpret it, loosely, as _vinisritam_.
    

    _Pāda_ d is suspicious and my translation is tentative. 


1.33 Anarthayajña spoke:
One, ten, a hundred, a thousand, and ten thousand (_ayuta_),
a hundred thousand (_prayuta_), a million (_niyuta_), ten millions (_koṭi_),
a hundred millions (_arbuda_), and a billion (_vṛnda_, 10${\uparrow}$9),


1.34 ten billion (_kharva_), a hundred billion (_nikharva_), one trillion (_śaṅku_, 10${\uparrow}$12),
and ten trillion (_padma_),
a hundred trillion (_samudra_), one quadrillion (_madhya_ 10${\uparrow}$15), ten quadrillion (_[an]anta_),
a hundred quadrillion (_parārdha_), and two hundred quadrillion (_para_).

NOTE:

    
    For _anta_ meaning _ananta_, see 1.58cd-59ab. 


1.35 All should be known as powers of ten up to _parārdha_.
The number corresponding to _para_ is double the _parārdha_.


1.36 There is no higher number than _para_. This is my conviction,
which is based on readings of the Purāṇas and the Vedas
and [which I have now] taught [to you], O great Brahmin.


1.37 Vigatarāga spoke:
How many eggs of Brahmā are there? And are its measurements available anywhere?
From how many finger's breadths high does the sun heat the earth?

NOTE:

    
    The word _prāpitaṃ_ is a conjecture for _cāpitaṃ_, which I find unintelligible.
    Another possibility could be _jñāpitaṃ_. 
    The purport of _pāda_s c and d is slightly obscure to me. 


1.38 Anarthayajña spoke:
How could I enumerate all the eggs of Brahmā, O Brahmin?
Even the gods don't know [all the details], not to mention mortals.


1.39 I shall teach [these details to you] one by one, as far as I can, O great Brahmin,
in the manner in which Brahmā taught Mātariśvan in the past, truthfully.

NOTE:

    
    One would expect _brahmāṇḍāni_ in _pāda_ a instead of _brahmāṇḍānāṃ_,
    but we should probably understand _brahmāṇḍānāṃ viśeṣān prasaṃkhyātuṃ..._ 
    Note that in _pāda_ d _mātariśvan_ stands for the accusative _mātariśvānaṃ_ or
    the dative _mātariśvane_ or the genitive _mātariśvanaḥ_.
    The claim that Brahmā taught Mātariśvan is confirmed in 1.64cd,
    again using the nominative for the accusative, dative or genitive, and
    also e.g. in Brahmāṇḍapurāṇa 3.4.58cd. 


1.40 ... CHECK
The ten names [of cosmic rulers/worlds] associated with each of the
eight directions in Brahmā's Egg, inside Śiva's Egg, [...], are being taught now, listen.

NOTE:

    
    The cruxed _pāda_ may have read _sarveṣām eva pūjitāḥ_ originally
    (`They are worshipped by all').
    Also consied _sarvadhā_ for _sarveṣāṃ_, see \msM.
    

    In _pāda_ c, understand _diśāṣṭānāṃ_ as _diśām aṣṭānāṃ_ or _digaṣṭakānāṃ_ 


1.41 [1] Saha, [2] Asaha, [3] Sahas, [4] Sahya, [5] Visaha, [6] Saṃhata, [7] Asabhā,
[8] Prasaha, [9] Aprasaha, [10] Sānu: [these are] the ten Leaders in the East.


1.42 [1] Prabhāsa, [2] Bhāsana, [3] Bhānu, [4] Pradyota, [5] Dyutima, [6] Dyuti,
[7] Dīptatejas, [8] Tejas, [9] Tejā, [10] Tejavaho: [these are] the ten


1.43 [leaders] in the direction of Agni [SE]. Now listen to [the names for]
the direction of Yama [S], O Brahmin.
[1] Yama, [2] Yamunā, [3] Yāma, [4] Saṃyama, [5] Yamuna, [6] Ayama,


1.44 [7] Saṃyana, [8] Yamanoyāna, [9] Yaniyugmā, [10] Yanoyana.


1.45 [1] Nagaja, [2] Naganā, [3] Nanda, [4] Nagara, [5] Naga, [6] Nandana,
[7] Nagarbha, [8] Gahana, [9] Guhyo, [10] Gūḍhaja: [these are] the ten associated with
[the South-West].
I shall teach you the [names] in Varuṇa's direction [in the west]. Listen, O Brahmin, learn from me.


1.46 [1] Babhra, [2] Setu, [3] Bhava, [4] Udbhadra, [5] Prabhava, [6] Udbhava, [7] Bhājana,
[8] Bharaṇa, [9] Bhuvana, and [10] Bhartṛ: these ten dwell in Varuṇa's direction [in the west].


1.47 [1] Nṛgarbha, [2] Asuragarbha, [3] Devagarbha, [4] Mahīdhara,
[5] Vṛṣabha, [6] Vṛṣagarbha, [7] Vṛṣāṅka, [8] Vṛṣabhadhvaja,


1.48 and [9] Vṛsaja and [10] Vṛṣanandana: these are to be known properly
as the ten leaders in Vāyu's direction [in the north-west], as I taught them, O Brahmin.


1.49 [1] Sulabha, [2] Sumana, [3] Saumya, [4] Supraja, [5] Sutanu, [6] Śiva,
[7] Sata, [8] Satya, [9] Laya, [10] Śambhu: [these are] the ten leaders in the north.


1.50 [1] Indu, [2] Bindu, [3] Bhuva, [4] Vajra, [5] Varada, [6] Vara, [7] Varṣaṇa,
[8] Ilana, [9] Valina, [10] Brahmā: [these are] the ten leaders in the Iśāna direction [in the north-east].


1.51 [1] Apara, [2] Vimala, [3] Moha, [4] Nirmala, [5] Mana, [6] Mohana,
[7] Akṣaya, [8] Avyaya, [9] Viṣṇu, [10] Varada: [these are] the ten [leaders] in the centre.


1.52 Each of the ten deities[?] has a retinue of a hundred [deities].
Each one in [these groups of] a hundred [deities] is surrounded by a thousand.


1.53 Each one in these [groups of] a thousand [deities] is surrounded by ten thousand
[deities].
The ten thousand by a multitude of a hundred thousand.
The hundred thousand is surrounded by a million,

NOTE:

    
    I chose to supply an _avagraha_ before _sahā_ only because all the sources
    consulted read _saṃhato_ as the previous word, making the _sandhi_
    _o-s_ suspicious.
    Note that many of the names here and in the following verses are,
    in the absence of any parallel passage, rather insecure.
    What is clear here is that the names evoke the name Sahasrākṣa, one of the appellations of
    Indra, the guadrian of the eastern direction. 
    I have choosen the variant _saṃyano_ in _pāda_ c only to avoid the repetition of
    the name _saṃyama_, and the variant _yanoyanaḥ_ because I suspect that
    most of the names here should begin with _ya_. All the name forms
    in this verse are to be taken as tentative. The only
    guiding light is the presence of _ya_, reinforcing a connection with Yama. 
    Note that the reconstruction of these names are tentative. What is clear here is that the
    initials should be _na_ and _ga_, probably suggesting a connection with _nāga_s. 
    We are forced to follow \Ed's readings here to make sense of this passage.
    Note that _vṛnda_ is not a number here. Elsewhere in this chapter it is the word that
    signifies `a billion'. 


1.54 [that is] each one has a retinue of a million [deities] (_niyuta_).
[Then] each [of those] is surrounded by ten million [deities] (_koṭi_),
[they] by a hundred million (_daśakoṭi_ = _arbuda_).

NOTE:

    
    Note how the scribe of \msM\ gets confused due to an eye-skip at 1.54c and
    fully regains control only at 1.56b. 


1.55 Each one of the hundred million (_daśakoṭi_ = _arbuda_) is surrounded by a billion (_vṛnda_) bhṛta???
Each of those billion (_vṛnda_) is surrounded by ten billion (_kharva_) [deities].


1.56 Each of those ten billion (_kharva_) is surrounded by a
hundred billion (_daśakharva_ = _nikharva_).
Each of those hundred billion (_daśakharva_ = _nikharva_)
is surrounded by one trillion (_śaṅku_) [deities].


1.57 Each of those one trillion (_śaṅku_) is surrounded be ten trillion (_padma_).
Each of those ten trillion (_padma_) is surrounded by a hundred trillion (_samudra_).


1.58 And each of those hundred trillion (_samudra_) is surrounded by those whose number is one quadrillion (_madhya_).
Each of those quadrillion (_madhya_) is surrounded by ten quadrillion (_ananta_).


1.59 Each of those ten quadrillion (_ananta_) is surrounded by a hundred quadrillion (_parārdha_).
Each of those hundred quadrillion (_parārdha_) is surrounded by two hundred quadrillion (_para_).
This is how it is taught, O Brahmin. [All] the possible numbers have been taught.

NOTE:

    
    Note _śaṅkubhiḥ pṛthag..._: it stands for _śaṅkūṣu pṛthag..._ (instrumental for locative). 
    The translation of _pāda_s c and d is tentative. 


1.60 Hear about the measurements [of the universe] briefly, O Brahmin, from me,
I shall teach [you].
Listen to the extent [of the Brahmāṇḍa], O Brahmin!
I shall teach it to you in a concise manner.
The body of the Egg is like that of the full moon at moonrise.


1.61 The whole circumference of the Eggs has been declared by Brahmā
to be _koṭi_ times a thousand _koṭi_ yojanas.

NOTE:

    
    aṇḍānāṃ plural...: a new egg in every mahākalpa? CHECK 


1.62 The Sun shines from above from seven thousand and seven hundred _koṭi_ [height] ... twenty _koṭi_ gulma?? mūrdha?


1.63 In brief the numbers pertaining to the measurements have been taught.
The characteristics of the unmeasurable Brahmāṇḍa[s] have been taught.


1.64 O true Brahmin, the Purāṇa[s of] 8,000,000 [verses]
were taught by [1] Brahmā to [2] Mātariśvan [= Vāyu] in their entirety,
in their true form.


1.65 Vāyu abridged the verses and then gave [the Purāṇas] to [3] Uśanas.
He [Uśanas] also abridged the verses, and [4] Bṛhaspati received them.


1.66 Bṛhaspati taught 30,000 [verses] to [5] Sūrya [the Sun].
Divākara [= the Sun] taught 25,000 [verses] to [6] Mṛtyu [Death].


1.67 Death taught 21,000 [verses] to [7] Indra.
Indra taught 20,000 verses to [8] Vasiṣṭha.


1.68 And he[, Vasiṣṭha taught] 18,000 [verses] to [9] Sārasvata.
Sārasvata [taught] 17,000 [verses] to [10] Tridhāman.


1.69 [Tridhāman] taught 16,000 verses to [11] Bharadvāja.
[Bharadvāja] taught 15,000 verses to [12] Trivṛṣa.


1.70 [Trivṛṣa] then [taught] 14,000 verses to [13] Antarīkṣa.
[Antarīkṣa] taught 13,000 [verses] to [14] Trayyāruṇi.


1.71 Trayyāruṇi, the great Brahmin, having abridged them again,
taught 12,000 [verses] to [15] Dhanaṃjaya.


1.72 Dhanaṃjaya, the great sage, handed [them] over to [16] Kṛtaṃjaya.
[This recension  was transmitted] from Kṛtaṃjaya, O great Brahmin, to [17] noble Ṛṇaṃjaya.


1.73 Then from Ṛṇaṃjaya it was given to [18] Gautama, the great sage,
from Gautama to [19] Bharadvāja, from him to [20] Dharmadvata.

NOTE:

    
    Note the mixture of different grammatical genders and numbers here.
    Understand _pramāṇeṣu saṃkhyāḥ kīrtitāḥ samāsataḥ_. 
    _Pāda_ a should probably be analysed and interpreted as
    _purāṇam (purāṇānām aśītisahasrāṇi śatāni ślokāni) brahmaṇā kathitam_.
    

    Compare this list to Viṣṇupurāṇa 3.3.11--19:
    

    _dvāpare prathame vyastaḥ svayaṃ vedaḥ svayaṃbhuvā|<br/>
    dvitīye dvāpare caiva vedavyāsaḥ prajāpati||<br/>
    tṛtīye cośanā vyāsaś caturthe ca bṛhaspatiḥ| <br/>

    gautamād uttaro vyāso haryātmā yo 'bhidhīyate|| <br/>
    atha haryātmanonte ca smṛto vājaśravāmuniḥ| <br/>

    aṣṭaviṃśatir ity ete vedavyāsāḥ purātanāḥ||  <br/>_
    

    Another relevant passage is Brahmāṇḍapurāṇa 3.4.58cd--67:
    

    _brahmā dadau śāstram idaṃ purāṇaṃ mātariśvane|| <br/>
    tasmāc cośanasā prāptaṃ tasmāc cāpi bṛhaspatiḥ|   <br/>
    bṛhaspatis tu provāca savitre tadanantaram||   <br/>

    The name _harmyadvata_ is probably a variant or a corrupted form
    of _harmyātman_, who appears in lists of _vedavyāsa_s
    in the Purāṇas (see note to 1.64). 


1.74 Then [21] Rājaśravas received it, then [22] Somaśuṣma.
Then from Somaśuṣma [23] Tṛṇabindu received it, O Brahmin.


1.75 Tṛṇabindu taught it to [24] Vṛkṣa, Vṛkṣa to [25] Śakti [the father of Parāśara].
Śakti taught it to [26] Parāśara, then [Parāśara] to [27] Jātūkarṇa.

NOTE:

    
    Perhaps keep jatu°. 


1.76 Jātukarṇa taught it to [28] [Vyāsa] Dvaipāyana, the great sage.
Dvaipāyana, the great sage, gave it to Romaharṣa.


1.77 He [Dvaipāyana] taught the Purāṇa[s]
[consisting of] 12,000 [verses] to Romaharṣa, his brilliant son,
[in the form that] has been revealed [to us]
for the benefit of humankind. What else do you wish to know?
