<p>Csaba Kiss, [2021. 12. 06. 19:24] Just an afterthought (not sure how much you use git and github): all this stuff about manuscript transmission, variants, stemmata, contamination etc‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve just realized (maybe it‚Äôs evident) that all this is extremely similar to git[hub] version control‚Ä¶ üòä : branches, head, master, forks, push, pull, commit, merge‚Ä¶ all these are synonyms of what we kind of see in Indian manuscript transmission. The only problem is that they did not have git in medieval times‚Ä¶ So Indian literary history is basically messy, chaotic free-software development without version control and with a lot of forks and branches, pulls and pushes. üòä</p>
<p>Kengo Harimoto, [2021. 12. 06. 19:27] Ha, absolutely true! The thing I was trying to explain today was very much like trying to incorporate a diff output into another version‚Ä¶ by hand. One person (or more?) miserably failiing‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Csaba Kiss, [2021. 12. 06. 19:29] Hahaha! Exactly! I wish we could just use diff and some automatic merge tool‚Ä¶ Or simply ‚Äòcheckout‚Äô at an early git branch. This parallel also reintroduces the question: do we want to go back to the first full commit of the author(s) or we should prefer a more developed version, potentially with more bugs‚Ä¶?</p>
<p>Kengo Harimoto, [2021. 12. 06. 19:31] Very good question! What I usually think of my goal is to get ‚Äúall‚Äù the version histories‚Ä¶ Basically what kind of mess has actually happened‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Csaba Kiss, [2021. 12. 06. 20:10] Yes, that would be ideal. To know the whole story. But which version do you publish? üòä</p>
