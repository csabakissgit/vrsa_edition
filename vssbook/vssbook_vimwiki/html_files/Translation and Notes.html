<p>1.1 Having bowed to [Him] whose boundaries are limitless, who has no beginning, no middle part and no end, [to Him] who is very subtle and who is the unmanifest and fine essence of the world, [to Him] who is respected as the foremost by Hari, Indra, Brahmā and the other [gods], I shall recite [the work called] `A Compendium on the Essence of the Bull [of Dharma]’.</p>
<p>NOTE:</p>
<pre><code>_Pāda_ a is reminiscent of, among other famous passages, Bhagavadgītā 11.19:
&lt;br/&gt;
_anādimadhyāntam anantavīryam &lt;br/&gt;
anantabāhuṃ śaśisūryanetram / &lt;br/&gt;
paśyāmi tvāṃ dīptahutāśavaktraṃ &lt;br/&gt;
svatejasā viśvam idaṃ tapantam //_ &lt;br/&gt;
This faint reference to the Bhagavadgītā seems proper at the
beginning of a work that claims to deliver a teaching
based on, but also to surpass, the Mahābhārata (see following verses).
See also e.g. Kūrmapurāṇa 1.11.237:&lt;br/&gt;
_rūpaṃ tavośeṣakalāvihīnam [tavā? CHECK]&lt;br/&gt;
agocaraṃ nirmalam ekarūpam / &lt;br/&gt;
anādimadhyāntam anantām [anantam? CHECK] ādyaṃ  &lt;br/&gt;
namāmi satyaṃ tamasaḥ parastāt_ // &lt;br/&gt;
To say that a god has no beginning and no end in a temporal or spacial
sense is natural (_anādi°...°antam_), but to have no `middle part&#39;
(_°madhya°_) in these senses is slightly less so.
Thus the rather commonly occuring phrase _anādimadhyāntam_ is probably not
much more than a fixed expression meaning `endless and/or eternal&#39;.
As to which god this stanza is referring to, it may be Śiva,
his name not being listed among those who treat him as chief god,
but the phrasing of the verse is vague enough to keep the question somewhat open:
the impersonal Brahman might be another option, even more so if we
look at 1.9--10, two verses nearby verses discussing _brahmavidyā_.



In _pāda_ b _jagat-susāraṃ_ is most probably not
to be interpreted as _jagatsu sāraṃ_.


Strictly speaking, _pāda_ c is unmetrical, but it is better to
simply acknowledge here the phenomenon of `muta cum liquida&#39;, namely
that syllables followed by consonant clusters such as
_ra, bra, hra, kra, śra, śya, śva, sva, dva_ can be treated as short.
Thus _harīndrabrahmā°_ can be treated as a regular beginning
of an _upajāti_ (. - . - -), the syllable
_bra_ not turning the previous syllable long.


The reading _āsamagraṃ_ in _pāda_ c is difficult to interpret.
\msM\ gives an exciting alternative (_yat samagraṃ_), but
it seems more like a guess to me than the correct reading.
The most tempting of all the possible corrections I have considered
(_arcyam/arhyam/arghyam/īḍyam agraṃ_)
seemed to be _āptam agraṃ_, meaning `appointed/received/respected
[by Hari, Indra, Brahmā etc.] as the foremost one&#39;.
The fact that the _akṣara_s _āsam_ and _āptam_ look similar
in most of the scripts used in our manuscripts supports this
conjecture.


Note how we could percieve the end of _pāda_s a and b,
as well as _pāda_s c and d as rhymes.


Is pāda d hypermetrical? It is actually a _vaṃśastha_ (_triṣṭubh - jagatī_ change).
See Apte App. A p. 4.

<p>1.2 Having listened to the Bhāratasaṃhitā [i.e. the Mahābhārata], the supreme book of a hundred thousand [verses], a thousand chapters (<em>adhyāya</em>) with all its hundred sections (<em>parvan</em>),</p>
<p>NOTE:</p>
<pre><code>The dialogue of Janamejaya and Vaiśampāyana make up the outermost layer of the VSS
(except for the introductory stanzas 1.1-3), which mostly contains
general _dharmaśāstric_ material.


The hundred _parvan_s of the Mahābhārata are listed in MBh 1.2.33--70. </code></pre>
<p>1.3 Janamejaya remained unsatisfied and what he asked Vaiśampāyana in the past, listen to that unweariedly.</p>
<p>NOTE:</p>
<pre><code>For a similar unsatisfaction or dissatisfaction with previous
teachings, see Niśvāsa mūla 1.9:


&lt;skt&gt;vedāntaṃ viditaṃ deva sāṃkhyaṃ vai pañcaviṃśakam |
na ca tṛptiṃ gamiṣyāmo hy ṛte śaivād anugrahāt ||&lt;/skt&gt;


and Śivadharmaśāstra... CHECK. 
Vaiśampāyana, a ṛṣi, the disciple of Vyāsa, recited the Mahābhārata at the snake sacrifice of
Janamejaya. CHECK SOURCE


Note how we are forced to emend _pāda_ c to contain a stem form proper noun (_janamejaya_)
to maintain the metre, and note how the manuscripts struggle with this _pāda_.
 </code></pre>
<p>1.4 Janamejaya spoke: O venerable sir, O knower of the entire Dharma, O you who are well-versed in all the sciences (<em>śāstra</em>)! Is there a supreme and secret Dharma which liberates [us] from the ocean of mundane existence (<em>saṃsāra</em>)?</p>
<p>NOTE:</p>
<pre><code>Note _dharma_ as a neuter noun in _pāda_ c and in the next verse. </code></pre>
<p>1.5 Teach me the Dharma that emerged from [Vyāsa] Dvaipāyana’s mouth, O best of Brahmins. Help me find satisfaction at all cost, O great ascetic!</p>
<p>1.6 Vaiśampāyana spoke: Listen with great attention, O king, to this unsurpassed narration of Dharma. Hear the secret Dharma that I received by Vyāsa’s favour.</p>
<p>1.7 – 1.8 Viṣṇu, the great Lord, assuming the form of a Brahmin, wanted to test the one who performed nonmaterial sacrifices, the one who focused on his austerities and observances, the one whose conduct was virtuous and pure, and who was intent on compassion towards all living beings, and therefore he humbly asked him a question.</p>
<p>NOTE:</p>
<pre><code>The majority of the MSS consulted include a _vā_ in _pāda_ b,
distinguishing between the `secret Dharma&#39; mentioned in 1.4c and
the one taught by Vyāsa. This may or may not be the better reading.
The reading of \msM\ is tempting. CHECK.
I decided to follow MS \msCb\ because I suspected that the two Dharmas
hinted at are the same. 
Note the odd syntax here: _viṣṇunā... dvijarūpadharo bhūtvā papraccha_.
The agent of the active verb is in the instrumental case. </code></pre>
<p>1.9 [Vigatarāga spoke:] How is the knowledge of Brahman to be understood if [this knowledge] is devoid of [definitions of the] form and colour [of Brahman]? [And] the syllable that is devoid of vowels and consonants: is that [its] highest [form]?</p>
<p>NOTE:</p>
<pre><code>The translation of this verse, and the reconstruction and interpretation
of _pāda_ d, which is echoed in 1.10d, is slightly tentative. </code></pre>
<p>1.10 Anarthayajña spoke: That syllable is not to be pronounced, is unquestionable, non-dividable, consistent, spotless, all-pervading and subtle: what could be higher than that?</p>
<p>NOTE:</p>
<pre><code>I interpret _pāda_ d, which is an echo of 1.9d, tentitvely as a compound,
slightly differently from the way I did above. </code></pre>
<p>1.11 Vigatarāga spoke: When the body disintegrates in the ground, in water, in fire or [is torn apart] by jackals and other [animals], how is the supportless and spotless soul led [to the netherworld] by Yama’s messengers?</p>
<p>1.12 How is it bound by the nooses of death/time? And if it is bodiless, how can it move? And how does the [soul of a] virtuous [person] (<em>bahudharmakṛt</em>) reach heaven if it has no body? Teach me about this doubtful matter (<em>saṃśaya</em>) that I am raising (<em>me</em>). I want to know the truth about it.</p>
<p>1.13 Anarthayajña spoke: You are asking me about an extremely doubtful and problematic matter, O great Brahmin. It is difficult to understand by humans, and [even] by gods (<em>deva</em>), demons (<em>dānava</em>) and serpents (<em>pannaga</em>).</p>
<p>1.14 The cause of both the birth and death of the body is karma. Good and bad deeds are called the two nooses.</p>
<p>1.15 [Man] goes to hell or heaven accordingly. Happiness and suffering, both arising from karma, are to be experienced by the body.</p>
<p>1.16 O great Brahmin, the body is produced for humans for his reason. Now learn about that which they call the noose of time, I shall teach you, O you of great observances.</p>
<p>1.17 [If] you don’t know anything, how could you start your investigation, O Brahmin? O Brahmin king, you should know the noose of time in its entirety.</p>
<p>1.18 Learn about time which is divided into digits (<em>kalā</em>), [i.e. about] the division[s] (<em>kalā</em>) of the entity [called] Time (<em>kālatattva</em>). Two atomic units of time (<em>truṭi</em>) is one twinkling (<em>nimeṣa</em>). One digit (<em>kalā</em>) is twice a twinkling.</p>
<p>NOTE:</p>
<pre><code>The word _°śivā°_ in _pāda_ b is slightly suspect, and could be the result
of metathesis, from _°viṣā°_ (`by poison&#39;). Nevertheless,
jackals seems appropriate in this context, for they
are commonly associated with human corpses, death and the cremation ground.
(see e.g. Ohnuma 2019)
(Reiko Ohnuma 2019 = Ohnuma, R. The Heretical, Heterodox Howl:
Jackals in Pāli Buddhist Literature. Religions 2019, 10, 221.) 
The word _kāla_ has, as usual, a double meaning in this verse: a _kālapāśa_
is both Yama&#39;s noose, and also the limitation caused by time,
as becomes clear at the discussion
on the different time units in verses 1.11--31. 
The variant _jijñāsyasi_ seems to be the lectio difficilior as opposed to
_vijñāsyasi_, but the latter could also work fine here. 
1.18d and 1.19a are problematic in the light of 1.19b, which
redefines _kalā_ in harmony with the traditional
interpretaion, see e.g. Arthaśāstra 2.20.33: _trimśatkāṣṭhāḥ kalāḥ_. </code></pre>
<p>1.19 Two digits (<em>kalā</em>) form one bit (3.2 seconds; <em>kāṣṭhā</em>). Thirty bits (<em>kāṣṭhā</em>) is one digit (1.6 minutes; <em>kalā</em>). Thirty digits (<em>kalā</em>) make up one section (48 minutes; <em>muhūrta</em>) according to mankind, O great Brahmin.</p>
<p>1.20 Thirty sections (<em>muhūrta</em>) are known to the wise as night and day [i.e. a full day]. Thirty days and nights are taught by the wise ones to be one month.</p>
<p>1.21 One year is twelve months [according to] people who know the entity of time. The time span of three hundred thousand plus sixty thousand years</p>
<p>1.22 by human standards is said to be the Kali era. The Dvāpara era is known to be twice as long as the Kali era.</p>
<p>NOTE:</p>
<pre><code>Note the stem form noun _yuga_ metri causa. </code></pre>
<p>1.23 The Tretā era is thrice [as long], the Kṛta era four [times as long as the Kali]. This is [how to add up] the number[s] related to the Four Yugas [= a <em>mahāyuga</em>]. Taking [this length of four _yuga_s] seventy-one [times],</p>
<p>NOTE:</p>
<pre><code>The element _°yugā°_ seems to stand for °yuga° metri causa.
If _°yugā_ and _saṃkhyā_ are to be separated, _eṣā_ becomes
problematic to interpret. </code></pre>
<p>1.24 the knowledge about one time-span of Manu is being taught briefly [i.e. 71 four-fold _mahāyuga_s make up a <em>manvantara</em>]. One Kalpa is fourteen _manvantara_s in total.</p>
<p>1.25 Brahmā’s day is made up of ten thousand Kalpas. [Brahmā’s] night is of the same [length] according to the wise who know the truth.</p>
<p>1.26 When [Brahmā’s] night falls, the whole moving and unmoving universe dissolves. And when [his] daylight comes, the moving and unmoving [universe] is born.</p>
<p>NOTE:</p>
<pre><code>See 21.34ff. 
The plural form _pralīyante_ in _pāda_ a is metri causa for _pralīyate_,
perhaps also influencing _utpadyante_ (for _utpadyate_) in _pāda_ d,
which in turn is used here to avoid an iambic pattern (- - . - . - . -). </code></pre>
<p>1.27 A <em>para</em> times <em>parārdha</em> [number of, i.e. two hundred quadrillion times a hundred quadrillion] <em>kalpas</em> have passed [so far], O great Brahmin. Bhṛgu and the other sages say that the future is the same [time span].</p>
<p>NOTE:</p>
<pre><code>Note the peculiar compound _bhṛgu-r-ādi-maharṣayaḥ_. </code></pre>
<p>1.28 Just as the sun, the planets, the stars and the moon are percieved by us as wandering around, the wheel of time (<em>kālacakra</em>) keeps spinning and we never experience its halting.</p>
<p>1.29 Time creates living beings and time destroys them again. Everything is under the control of time. There is nothing that can bring time under control.</p>
<p>1.30 Fourteen _parārdha_s is [the number of] the kings of the gods [i.e. Indras?], O Brahmin, who passed by over time, for time is difficult to overcome.</p>
<p>NOTE:</p>
<pre><code>Note that _samatītāni_ (neuter) most probably picks up _devarājāḥ_
(masculine) in this verse, or rather _devarājā_ stands for
_devarājānāṃ_ and _samatītāni_ picks up _°parārdhāni_. </code></pre>
<p>1.31 Time is [manifest] as a great yogin, as Brahmā, Viṣṇu and supreme Śiva, it is beginningless and endless, it is the creator, the great soul. Pay homage [to Time].</p>
<p>1.32 Vigatarāga spoke: I have just heard [the term] `wheel of time’ (<em>kālacakra</em>) uttered from [your] lotus mouth, as well as <em>parārdha</em> and <em>para</em>. You have made these things appear as exciting, as things to hear.</p>
<p>NOTE:</p>
<pre><code>The reading of all manuscripts consulted, _vinisṛtam_,
may be considered metrical if we interpret it, loosely, as _vinisritam_.


_Pāda_ d is suspicious and my translation is tentative. </code></pre>
<p>1.33 Anarthayajña spoke: One, ten, a hundred, a thousand, and ten thousand (<em>ayuta</em>), a hundred thousand (<em>prayuta</em>), a million (<em>niyuta</em>), ten millions (<em>koṭi</em>), a hundred millions (<em>arbuda</em>), and a billion (<em>vṛnda</em>, 10${}$9),</p>
<p>1.34 ten billion (<em>kharva</em>), a hundred billion (<em>nikharva</em>), one trillion (<em>śaṅku</em>, 10${}<span class="math inline">12), <em>a</em><em>n</em><em>d</em><em>t</em><em>e</em><em>n</em><em>t</em><em>r</em><em>i</em><em>l</em><em>l</em><em>i</em><em>o</em><em>n</em>(<sub><em>p</em></sub><em>a</em><em>d</em><em>m</em><em>a</em><sub>)</sub>, <em>a</em><em>h</em><em>u</em><em>n</em><em>d</em><em>r</em><em>e</em><em>d</em><em>t</em><em>r</em><em>i</em><em>l</em><em>l</em><em>i</em><em>o</em><em>n</em>(<sub><em>s</em></sub><em>a</em><em>m</em><em>u</em><em>d</em><em>r</em><em>a</em><sub>)</sub>, <em>o</em><em>n</em><em>e</em><em>q</em><em>u</em><em>a</em><em>d</em><em>r</em><em>i</em><em>l</em><em>l</em><em>i</em><em>o</em><em>n</em>(<sub><em>m</em></sub><em>a</em><em>d</em><em>h</em><em>y</em><em>a</em><sub>10</sub></span>{}$15), ten quadrillion (<em>[an]anta</em>), a hundred quadrillion (<em>parārdha</em>), and two hundred quadrillion (<em>para</em>).</p>
<p>NOTE:</p>
<pre><code>For _anta_ meaning _ananta_, see 1.58cd-59ab. </code></pre>
<p>1.35 All should be known as powers of ten up to <em>parārdha</em>. The number corresponding to <em>para</em> is double the <em>parārdha</em>.</p>
<p>1.36 There is no higher number than <em>para</em>. This is my conviction, which is based on readings of the Purāṇas and the Vedas and [which I have now] taught [to you], O great Brahmin.</p>
<p>1.37 Vigatarāga spoke: How many eggs of Brahmā are there? And are its measurements available anywhere? From how many finger’s breadths high does the sun heat the earth?</p>
<p>NOTE:</p>
<pre><code>The word _prāpitaṃ_ is a conjecture for _cāpitaṃ_, which I find unintelligible.
Another possibility could be _jñāpitaṃ_. 
The purport of _pāda_s c and d is slightly obscure to me. </code></pre>
<p>1.38 Anarthayajña spoke: How could I enumerate all the eggs of Brahmā, O Brahmin? Even the gods don’t know [all the details], not to mention mortals.</p>
<p>1.39 I shall teach [these details to you] one by one, as far as I can, O great Brahmin, in the manner in which Brahmā taught Mātariśvan in the past, truthfully.</p>
<p>NOTE:</p>
<pre><code>One would expect _brahmāṇḍāni_ in _pāda_ a instead of _brahmāṇḍānāṃ_,
but we should probably understand _brahmāṇḍānāṃ viśeṣān prasaṃkhyātuṃ..._ 
Note that in _pāda_ d _mātariśvan_ stands for the accusative _mātariśvānaṃ_ or
the dative _mātariśvane_ or the genitive _mātariśvanaḥ_.
The claim that Brahmā taught Mātariśvan is confirmed in 1.64cd,
again using the nominative for the accusative, dative or genitive, and
also e.g. in Brahmāṇḍapurāṇa 3.4.58cd. </code></pre>
<p>1.40 … CHECK The ten names [of cosmic rulers/worlds] associated with each of the eight directions in Brahmā’s Egg, inside Śiva’s Egg, […], are being taught now, listen.</p>
<p>NOTE:</p>
<pre><code>The cruxed _pāda_ may have read _sarveṣām eva pūjitāḥ_ originally
(`They are worshipped by all&#39;).
Also consied _sarvadhā_ for _sarveṣāṃ_, see \msM.


In _pāda_ c, understand _diśāṣṭānāṃ_ as _diśām aṣṭānāṃ_ or _digaṣṭakānāṃ_ </code></pre>

<pre><code>I chose to supply an _avagraha_ before _sahā_ only because all the sources
consulted read _saṃhato_ as the previous word, making the _sandhi_
_o-s_ suspicious.
Note that many of the names here and in the following verses are,
in the absence of any parallel passage, rather insecure.
What is clear here is that the names evoke the name Sahasrākṣa, one of the appellations of
Indra, the guadrian of the eastern direction. 
I have choosen the variant _saṃyano_ in _pāda_ c only to avoid the repetition of
the name _saṃyama_, and the variant _yanoyanaḥ_ because I suspect that
most of the names here should begin with _ya_. All the name forms
in this verse are to be taken as tentative. The only
guiding light is the presence of _ya_, reinforcing a connection with Yama. 
Note that the reconstruction of these names are tentative. What is clear here is that the
initials should be _na_ and _ga_, probably suggesting a connection with _nāga_s.

<p>1.63 In brief the numbers pertaining to the measurements have been taught. The characteristics of the unmeasurable Brahmāṇḍa[s] have been taught.</p>
<p>1.64 O true Brahmin, the Purāṇa[s of] 8,000,000 [verses] were taught by [1] Brahmā to [2] Mātariśvan [= Vāyu] in their entirety, in their true form.</p>
<p>1.65 Vāyu abridged the verses and then gave [the Purāṇas] to [3] Uśanas. He [Uśanas] also abridged the verses, and [4] Bṛhaspati received them.</p>
<p>1.66 Bṛhaspati taught 30,000 [verses] to [5] Sūrya [the Sun]. Divākara [= the Sun] taught 25,000 [verses] to [6] Mṛtyu [Death].</p>

<p>NOTE:</p>
<pre><code>Note the mixture of different grammatical genders and numbers here.
Understand _pramāṇeṣu saṃkhyāḥ kīrtitāḥ samāsataḥ_. 
_Pāda_ a should probably be analysed and interpreted as
_purāṇam (purāṇānām aśītisahasrāṇi śatāni ślokāni) brahmaṇā kathitam_.

The name _harmyadvata_ is probably a variant or a corrupted form
of _harmyātman_, who appears in lists of _vedavyāsa_s
in the Purāṇas (see note to 1.64). </code></pre>
