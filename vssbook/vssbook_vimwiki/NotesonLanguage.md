Notes on the language
=====================

<!-- Back to Introduction.md -->

The language of the VSS goes beyond the idiosyncrasies of
epic Sanskrit.  It exhibits strong similarities to Śaiva
Aiśa Sanskrit,^[
                See Goodall, Törzsök, Hatley, Kiss,
                Meyr?]
and it applies particular metrical licences and uses a special
vocabulary, morphology and syntax. The analysis of this
language may lead us to the author(s) and to the place
of composition. Here I only give a brief overview
of the most important phenomena. For details 
see the Notes on the constitution of the Sanskrit text
and the Index.


Metre
-----

As regards metrical licences, the first striking feature is
the generous use of the poetic licence sometimes labelled
'muta cum liquida,'[^mutacumliquida]
namely that some consonant clusters that would normally
turn the previous short (laghu) syllable long (guru)
may in some cases do not do so. The syllables pra, bra,
hra, kra, especially at the beginning of words CHECK,
are well-known candidates for this licence.[^knownlicence]
In the VSS, tra, vra, śra, pra, and also śya, śva,
sva, dva, all involving conjunct consonants with a liquid
sounds or semi-vowels in second position, and possibly
also rpa,CHECK! seem additional ones.

  [^mutacumliquida]:
  For recent contributions on this phenomenon,
  see e.g.  Ranjan Sen 2006 (discussing it as
  appearing in Latin) and Balogh 2018, note 6
  (discussing Sanskrit metre).

  [^knownlicence]:
  See e.g. Apte' XXX Dictionary Appendix A p. 1. ADD
  real life examples.
          
The well-known author on prosody, Kedārabhaṭṭa, who must
definitely be much later than the time of composition of the
VSS since he is frequently quoted by Mallinātha, gives the
following definition in his Vṛttaratnākara (here given
together with Sulhana's Sukavihṛdayanandinī commentary):

> *padādāv iha varṇasya saṃyogaḥ kramasaṃjñikaḥ* |  
*puraḥsthitena tena syāl laghutā 'pi kvacid guroḥ* || 1.10 || 

>> *vibhaktyantaṃ padaṃ tasya padasyādau vartamāno
yo varṇas tasya saṃyogaḥ* | *sa iha śāstre
kramasaṃjño jñeyaḥ* | *tena krameṇa purovartinā
prākpadānte vartamānasya prāptagurubhāvasyāpi
laghutā syāt* | *kvacil lakṣānurodhena* |
*nanu ka eṣaḥ kramo nāma saṃyoga ucyate* |
*pūrvācāryāṇāṃ piṅgalanāgaprabhṛtīnāṃ
kālidāsādīnāṃ ca kavīnāṃ samayaḥ
parigṛhītaḥ* | *saṃyogaḥ kramasaṃyogaḥ* || 10 ||<br>
>> *tatra gra-saṃyogena yathā* | *idam asyodāharaṇam* |

> *taruṇaṃ sarṣapaśākaṃ navaudanaṃ picchalāni ca dadhīni* |  
*alpavyayena sundari grāmyajano miṣṭam aśnāti* || 1.11 || 

TRANSLATE the whole passage!

> In this [work], a consonant cluster at the beginning of
a word is called krama. A [preceding] long syllable can
sometimes be turned short by that initial [syllable].

>>        ... TRANSLATE 

> Tender mustard seed, fresh porridge, and slimy curds:
village people eat this kind of dishes, O beautiful 
goddess, due to lack of money. 




To sum this example up: the verse given above (1.11) is
in āryā, and the metric pattern of the second half-verse
is the following: - - . - . - . - - . . - - . - - -
This yields 28 morae, instead of the expected 27. By
treating the final syllable of sundari short, in spite of
the following grā, the pattern conforms to the expected
pattern: - - . - . - . . - . . - - . - - - 

The commentator gives several more examples (involving the
syllables gra, hra, bhra), including this Śārdūla line:

> nidravyo hriyam eti hrīparigataḥ prabhraśyate tejasaḥ
   
In this line, the last syllable of eti should count as
short, in spite of the fact that the beginning of the next
word (hrī°) would normally turn it long.
 
The VSS abounds in this phenomenon of 'muta
cum liquida'. EXAMPLES from the VSS and from my
emendations. CHECK

- only beginning of words in the VSS?
- final -am etc. counts as long (reverse of muta cum liquida)



- In Kannada and Telugu prosody, under the name of
śithila-dvitva, the
 exception is that sometimes in a consonant cluster of the
 form [consonant + "r"], the "r" (repha) can be ignored,
 so that it is not a conjunct consonant anymore.


-  The exception is not accepted by purists: Shatavadhani
Ganesh says that
   the Sanskrit masters like Kālidāsa, Bhāravi, Māgha,
   Śrīharṣa, and Viśākhadatta have not freely used
   this exception (though the masters in Kannada and other
   languages have).  Being more of a "poetic licence"
   and a violation of the standard rule (only found in
   later poetry), it is extremely unlikely that any sane
   poet would have indulged in that exception in all four
   pāda-s of a verse.  Thus it is very unlikely that the
   program will miss identifying a verse that indulges
   in this

Vocabulary  
----------

 - Special vocabulary/language: karhacit, hṛdi as
 nominative 10.27cd, tirya, me as mayā


Number and gender 
-----------------

 - Number: singular next to numerals, and general confusion
 (CHECK)


Syntax  
------

- Special structures: 
                 caturmaunasya vakṣyāmi
                 indreṇāsmi phalaṃ dattaṃ

Stem form nouns  
---------------

- stem form nouns (prātipadika)

 - a more or less full collation is important: we cannot
 automatically
reject 'ungrammatical' or unmetrical forms because they
may well be the 'original' one
