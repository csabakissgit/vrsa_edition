\mychapter{Preface}

\section{Aims and problems}
\frenchspacing

\noindent
What is this edition? It is not much more than
 a new copy, and carefully prepared new version
of a text called \Vss, based on a number of witnesses,
augmented with an analysis of the contents, with
contextualisation, and with an English translation.
As for the critical editoin, while I went to great 
lengths to understand the textual history behind 
the manuscripts used, it is obviously a deeply contaminated 
version of a text transmitted through contaminated witnesses.
Nevertheless, it is hopefully a version that is as 
close to the authors' and redactors' original intention
around the time they assembled these chapters together, 
approximately in the seventh to tenth centuries, as possible. 
Of course we do not know if there was a single moment
when the intention to compose a new text on Dharma
under the title \Vss\ was born or if there was one single
`original copy',%
		\footnote{This reminds one of James McLaverty's
				         question (as quoted in 
   				        \mycitep{McGannTextualCondition}{??}):
				``If the Mona Lisa is in the Louvre in Paris, where is Hamlet?''}
but it is hopefully the most meaningful and most readable
among all available copies. Still, the present book is just a
version of a text that surely has never existed exactly 
in this very form, inevitably showing
signs of being an eclectic edition. 
Furthermore, it may show unintentional 
characteristics of the 21th century 
(ones that go beyond the modern Devanāgarī font face
or occasional choices based on our modern misunderstandings) 
mixed with characteristics of the first millenium. 
We know that `[a]ll editing is an act of interpretation'.% 		
		\footnote{\mycitep{McGannTextualCondition}{??}.}
		\todo{Find a hard copy of McGann's Textual Condition.}
And many of the editorial decisions I made were based
on opinions expressed by colleagues during our
regular reading sessions. Thus this edition is a result
of the interpretative power of a group of scholars, and
this may sometimes have, but hopefully rarely, caused contradictions.

And as to complicate things, we are publishing this long text
in two volumes, and the second volume is still in the making
when the first comes out. This may produce various problems:
of interpretation, of internal references, of repetition, 
and most importantly of presenting a text of
embedded and recurring layers cut in half. To counteract
some of these problems, I have finished editing and 
studying some of the most significant passages in 
the second part of the text by the time I let the first one
out of my hands; some of these the reader can find in 
the Appendices. A further minor problem arises when
I discuss topics that I have already touched upon in \mycite{KissVolume2022}: some overlaps are inevitable.

And what is the purpose of this edition? The main 
objective of the \textsc{śiva\-dharma project} 
has been to understand the function of 
individual texts within the so-called Śivadharma corpus,
and thus the \emph{raison d'être} of the corpus itself,
better. My attempt is rather simplistic: it is to understand
what the \Vss\ tried to convey when when it was composed and
to try to see why this text got inserted in those multi-text 
manuscripts that usually transmit the so-called Śivadharma corpus.
But even without this ideal to understand the purpose and function 
of the \Vss, to make a pre-eleventh-century
Sanskrit text easily available in the twenty-first century is, I believe, 
a noble aspiration.

\section{Reading the \Vsssc}

\subsection{The title}
The title \Vss\ can be translated as:
`A Compendium on the Essence of the Bull [of Dharma].'
The last two elements (\skt{sāra-saṃgraha}) need
little explanation: this work is a 
`compendium' on, a `collection' or `summary' of (\skt{saṃgraha})
the `essence' (\skt{sāra}) of its topic. The words 
`compendium' and `collection' reflect the composite nature of
the \Vss\ well; see sections on the structure of the text and
on the its possible sources on pp. ??ff and pp. ??ff.
The remaining question is weather the bull in the title 
is only a reference to a representation of Dharma 
or also a hint at Śiva's bull, his vehicle or mount, 
sometimes called Nandi or Nandin in other works.%
		\footnote{There is no trace of Nandi/Nandin 
		as identified with the bull in the \Vss.
		On the possible time after which 
		Nandi or Nandin, originally a \cskt{gaṇa}{gana} 
		was considered a \csindex{bull}, see 
		\mycite{bhattacharya_nandin_1977}.}

Dharma is frequently referred to as a (four-legged) 
bull in Sanskrit literature from at least the time of the \MBh. 
See, e.g., this passage (\MBH\ 3.188.10--13):

\begin{quote}
{\small
  \skt{kṛte \textbf{catuṣpāt} sakalo nirvyājopādhivarjitaḥ} |\\
  \skt{vṛṣaḥ pratiṣṭhito dharmo manuṣyeṣv abhavat purā} || 10 ||\\
  \skt{adharmapādaviddhas tu tribhir aṃśaiḥ pratiṣṭhitaḥ} |\\
  \skt{tretāyāṃ dvāpare 'rdhena vyāmiśro dharma ucyate} || 11 ||\\
  \skt{tribhir aṃśair adharmas tu lokān ākramya tiṣṭhati} |\\
  \skt{caturthāṃśena dharmas tu manuṣyān upatiṣṭhati} || 12 ||\\
  \skt{āyur vīryam atho buddhir balaṃ tejaś ca pāṇḍava} |\\
  \skt{manuṣyāṇām anuyugaṃ hrasatīti nibodha me} || 13 ||\\
  }
\end{quote}

Śiva got his bull, MBh:
13076027a vṛṣabhaṃ ca dadau tasmai saha tābhiḥ prajāpatiḥ
13076027c prasādayām āsa manas tena rudrasya bhārata
13076028a prītaś cāpi mahādevaś cakāra vṛṣabhaṃ tadā
13076028c dhvajaṃ ca vāhanaṃ caiva tasmāt sa vṛṣabhadhvajaḥ
13076029a tato devair mahādevas tadā paśupatiḥ kṛtaḥ
13076029c īśvaraḥ sa gavāṃ madhye vṛṣāṅka iti cocyate


Manusmṛti also confirms this (8.16a): vṛṣo hi bhagavān dharma.

MMW `vṛṣa':\\
``Justice or Virtue personified as a bull or as''Siva's bull Mn. viii,
16 Pur. Kāvyād.; just or virtuous act, virtue, moral merit ``Siś.
Vās.;''

Mahākṣapaṇaka's koṣa (CHECK date), the Anekārthadhvanimañjarī, places
the meaning `dharma' as first when defining the word `vṛṣa':

\begin{quote}
    \skt{dharmo vṛṣo vṛṣaḥ śreṣṭho vṛṣo gaur mūṣiko vṛṣaḥ} |\\
    \skt{vṛṣo balaṃ vṛṣaḥ kāmo vṛṣalo vṛṣa ucyate} || 1.48
    \end{quote}

The ŚDhU also mentions the `Dharma bull':

\begin{quote}
    \skt{īśvarāyatanasyādhaḥ śrīmān dharmavṛṣaḥ sthitaḥ} |\\
    \skt{yatra vīravṛṣas tatra kṣityāṃ gomātaraḥ sthitā} || 12.87
\end{quote}

visnusmrḍn:ViS 86.15a/ vṛṣo hi bhagavān dharmaś catuṣ-pādaḥ prakīrtitaḥ
/

Śivapurāṇa 2.3.40.54--55:

\begin{quote}
\skt{śuddhasphaṭikasaṃkāśo vṛṣabhaḥ sarvasundaraḥ} |\\
\skt{yo dharma ucyate vedaiḥ śāstraiḥ siddhamaharṣibhiḥ} ||\\
\skt{tam ārūḍho mahādevo vṛṣabhaṃ dharmavatsalaḥ} |\\
\skt{śuśubhe 'tīva devarṣisevitaḥ sakalair vrajan} ||
\end{quote}

%On the title, see 
%\mycite{DeSiminiMSSFromNepal2016} (238, n.\thinspace 13):
% `'As noted by \Sanderson\
%{[}\ldots{}{]}, this title can have a double meaning, since the `bull'
%(vṛṣa) is both a synonym of `religious practice' and the traditional
%mount (vāhana) of Śiva. i.e.~Sanderson (Forthc. b), Śaivism and
%Brahmanism. (can't find it)

\mycite{SandersonTolerance2015} (210 n.~136), in general,
on \cskt{vṛṣa}{vrsa} being Dharma, and
on the bull appearing on the coins of the 
Hephthalite Hun Mihirakula in particular says the following: 

\begin{quote}
{\footnotesize
To laud the bull (\cskt{vṛṣa}{vrsa}) 
would be surprising if the intended meaning were 
the bull that is Śiva's mount, but not if the word is intended in its figurative meaning, namely \skt{dharmaḥ}, 
or \skt{sukṛtam} `the virtuous actions [prescribed by
the Veda].' For this meaning of \skt{vṛṣaḥ} see, for example,
Amarasiṃha, \skttitle{Nāmaliṅgānuśāsana}{Nmalinganusasana} 
1.4.25b (\skt{sukṛtam vṛṣaḥ}),
3.3.220 (\skt{sukṛte vṛṣabhe vṛṣaḥ}); 
Halāyudha,
\skttitle{Abhidhānaratnamālā}{Abhidhanaratnamala} 1.125cd (\skt{dharmaḥ puṇyaṃ vṛṣaḥ śreyaḥ
sukṛtaṃ ca samaṃ smṛtam}); 
\skttitle{Manusmṛti}{Manusmrit} 8[.]16a
(\skt{vṛṣo hi bhagavān dharmas}\dots); 
and the Gwalior Museum Stone
Inscription of Pataṅgaśambhu (\mycite{MirashiGwalior1962}), l. 15,
\skt{vṛṣaikaniṣṭho `pi jitasmaro 'pi yaḥ śaṅkaro 'bhūd 
bhuvi ko 'py apūrvvaḥ}, 
concerning the Śaiva ascetic Vyomaśambhu: 
`He was in the
world an extraordinary new Śiva, since he too was 
\skt{vṛṣaikaniṣṭhaḥ}
(`devoted solely to pious observance'; 
in Śiva's case `riding only on the Bull') and he too was 
\skt{jitasmaraḥ} (`one who had defeated sensual
urges'; in Śiva's case `the defeater of the Love god Kāmadeva'). 
This is also the meaning of \skt{vṛṣaḥ} in the title \Vss,
one of the works of the Śivadharma corpus 
(see, e.g., \mycitep{SandersonSaivaLit2014}{p.~2}), i.e., 
`Summary of the Essentials of the [Śiva]dharma'. 
}
\end{quote}

\noindent
In his last sentence here, \Sanderson\ implies that the
\Vss\ is organically part of the teachings that we call
the Śivadharma corpus, and thus he adds Śiva in
square brackets when translating the title 
\Vss. A closer examination of the \VSS\ 
reveals no direct references to either Śiva's bull or
to the bull as embodying the Śivadharma. Instead, the bull
in the \VSS\ is repeatedly associated with the Dharma that
is the four \asrama s (see p. \pageref{bullasfourasramas}).
My conclusion is that while the word \skt{vṛṣa} in the
title may well carry a reference to Śiva's bull, it is always
only implied and never explicitely taught, while the bull as
the personification of Dharma as the four
\asrama s explicitely appears. Thus
the title actually lacks any explicit hint to Śaivism, which
fits in well with the rather blurred and multi-layered 
affiliation of the text to Dharmaśāstra, Vaiṣṇavism and Śaivism.%
		\footnote{See also \mycitep{BakkerWorld2014}{69}, who 
			while discussing a seal of Śarvavarman that 
			features a beautifully carved bull representing Dharma,
			remarks: `The reader may also see in the 
			image the thriving Śaiva religion, represented
			by the Bull, the vāhana of Śiva [\dots]'} 





\citeauthor{bhattacharya_nandin_1977} (\citeyear{bhattacharya_nandin_1977}, {1552}) suggests this:
`In the Purāṇas the bull 
(Vṛṣabha\index{vrsabha@\skt{vṛṣabha}} or 
Vṛṣa\index{vrsa@\skt{vṛṣa}}) 
of Śiva is identified with Dharma, ``virtue personified''. 
This is a new development to sanctify the animal 
vehicle of the god. This new situation took place with the religious 
rite when an offering of a bull to a Brahmin deemed to be
of a high religious merit.' Is he ignoring the fact that Dharma as
a bull appears already in the \MBh?
He comes to the conclusion 
(\mycitep{bhattacharya_nandin_1977}{1555})
that one of the earliest sources to fuse the figures
of Nandin and the bull is the relatively early%
		\footnote{See \mycitep{RocherPuranas1986}{199}.}
\MatsP.


\mysubsubsection{Vṛṣadeva's commission?}
As a fanciful experiment, and if one supposes that the 
\VSS\ originated in Nepal, one could wonder if the 
title \Vss\ has anything to do with the Licchavi king
Vṛṣadeva.
\citeauthor{SandersonSaivaAge} 
(\citeyear{SandersonSaivaAge}, 74) mentions that  
Vṛṣadeva is `described in an inscription of his eighth-century 
descendant Jayadeva as having inclined towards Buddhism;'
(\mycitep{Vajracarya1973}{148, l. 9}: 
\skt{sugataśāsanapakṣapātī}) 
`a view conﬁrmed by a local chronicle, which attributes to
him the establishing of Buddhist images,'
%fn: Lévi 1990, vol. 2, p. 98.
and that this king established 
`the Caitya of the Sı̄nagu-vihāra (the Svayambhūnāth Caitya).'
More importantly, Sanderson summarises the 
information to be found in the 
Changu Narayana Pillar Inscription (east shaft),%
		\footnote{Gnoli etc. and 
		https://siddham.network/inscription/in02001/} 
namely that Vṛṣadeva was the great-grandfather of Mānadeva, whose
`dated inscriptions range in date from 459 to 505/6 [\CE]'
(\mycitep{SandersonSaivaAge}{75}).%
	   \footnote{Vṛṣadeva was succeeded by Śaṅkaradeva and
	   		            Dharmadeva.}
This would place 
the reign of Vṛṣadeva around 400 \CE. 
The early fifth century may look too early for the date of composition
of the \Vss, and any connection between this king
and the text is impossible to prove at the moment, 
but it is equally impossible to reject any connection, 
and if there were one, it would give some explanation for the slightly
unusual nature of the title.

    is this text really Śaiva? why in this collection?
  \item
    niśvāsa as sadāśiva in ch.~16; Niśvāsa uttarasūtra 5.50-51; see also
    Kafle Niśvāsamukha p.11ff; ibid. p.12: ``The term niśvāsa means
    sighing. Thus, an alternative meaning of the Niśvāsatattvasaṃhitā
    could also be a ``sighing tantra.'' To be more precise, a tantra
    that originated from the sighing of Śiva. This is to say, the speech
    of Śiva.''

\subsection{Notes on the language}

\noindent
The language of the VSS goes beyond the idiosyncrasies of epic Sanskrit.
It exhibits strong similarities to Śaiva Aiśa Sanskrit,% 
		\footnote{See Goodall, Törzsök, Hatley, Kiss, Meyr?} 
and it applies particular metrical licences and 
uses a special vocabulary, morphology and syntax.
The analysis of this language, ideally, could lead us to the 
author(s) or redactors of the text and to its
place of composition. Here I only give a brief overview of the most
important phenomena. For details see the observatoins 
on the constitution of the Sanskrit text in the footnotes 
to the translation (pp. ??), as well as the Index.


\subsection{Metre}
As regards metrical licences, the first striking feature is the generous
use of the poetic licence sometimes labelled `muta cum
liquida,'\footnote{For recent contributions on this phenomenon, see
  e.g.~Ranjan Sen 2006 (discussing it as appearing in Latin) and Balogh
  2018, note 6 (discussing Sanskrit metre).} namely that some consonant
clusters that would normally turn the previous short (laghu) syllable
long (guru) may in some cases do not do so. The syllables pra, bra, hra,
kra, especially at the beginning of words CHECK, are well-known
candidates for this licence.\footnote{See e.g.~Apte' XXX Dictionary
  Appendix A p.~1. ADD real life examples.} In the VSS, tra, vra, śra,
pra, and also śya, śva, sva, dva, all involving conjunct consonants with
a liquid sounds or semi-vowels in second position, and possibly also
rpa,CHECK! seem additional ones.

The well-known author on prosody, Kedārabhaṭṭa (11-12th centuries),%
		\footnote{SOURCE}	 
frequently quoted by Mallinātha, gives the following definition in his
\skttitle{Vṛttaratnākara}{Vrttaratnakara} (here given together with Sulhaṇa's \skttitle{Sukavihṛdayanandinī}{Sukavihrdayanandini} commentary):

\begin{quote}

\textbar{}\\
\emph{alpavyayena sundari grāmyajano miṣṭam aśnāti} \textbar{}\textbar{}
1.11 \textbar{}\textbar{}
\end{quote}

TRANSLATE the whole passage!

\begin{quote}
In this {[}work{]}, a consonant cluster at the beginning of a word is
called krama. A {[}preceding{]} long syllable can sometimes be turned
short by that initial {[}syllable{]}.
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
\begin{quote}
\begin{quote}
   ... TRANSLATE 
\end{quote}
\end{quote}
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
Tender mustard seed, fresh porridge, and slimy curds: village people eat
this kind of dishes, O beautiful goddess, due to lack of money.
\end{quote}

To sum this example up: the verse given above (1.11) is in āryā, and the
metric pattern of the second half-verse is the following: - - . - . - .
- - . . - - . - - - This yields 28 morae, instead of the expected 27. By
treating the final syllable of sundari short, in spite of the following
grā, the pattern conforms to the expected pattern: - - . - . - . . - . .
- - . - - -

The commentator gives several more examples (involving the syllables
gra, hra, bhra), including this Śārdūla line:

\begin{quote}
nidravyo hriyam eti hrīparigataḥ prabhraśyate tejasaḥ
\end{quote}

In this line, the last syllable of eti should count as short, in spite
of the fact that the beginning of the next word (hrī°) would normally
turn it long.

The VSS abounds in this phenomenon of `muta cum liquida'. EXAMPLES from
the VSS and from my emendations. CHECK

\begin{itemize}
\item
  only beginning of words in the VSS?
\item
  final -am etc. counts as long (reverse of muta cum liquida)
\item
  In Kannada and Telugu prosody, under the name of śithila-dvitva, the
  exception is that sometimes in a consonant cluster of the form
  {[}consonant + ``r''{]}, the ``r'' (repha) can be ignored, so that it
  is not a conjunct consonant anymore.
\item
  The exception is not accepted by purists: Shatavadhani Ganesh says
  that the Sanskrit masters like Kālidāsa, Bhāravi, Māgha, Śrīharṣa, and
  Viśākhadatta have not freely used this exception (though the masters
  in Kannada and other languages have). Being more of a ``poetic
  licence'' and a violation of the standard rule (only found in later
  poetry), it is extremely unlikely that any sane poet would have
  indulged in that exception in all four pāda-s of a verse. Thus it is
  very unlikely that the program will miss identifying a verse that
  indulges in this

\mychapter{A Critical Edition of Vṛṣasārasaṃgraha 1--12}

\section{Witnesses}
\frenchspacing

\noindent
In the manuscript descriptions below, in addition to some general
remarks, I will mainly focus on information relevant to the VSS. For
much more detail on the overall features of these manuscripts, see 
\mycite{DeSiminiMSSFromNepal2016} and the catalogues I mention
at each individual manuscript.%
		\footnote{I owe thanks to Florinda De Simini for 
			sharing with me most of the manuscripts listed here, to
  			Kengo Harimoto and Gudrun Melzer (Munich) for 
  			providing photos of the  Munich MS, and to 
  			Nirajan Kafle for sharing the Paris MS with me.}

In recently published and forthcoming critical editions of and articles
on the Śivadharma corpus 
(e.g. \mycite{bisschop_universal_2018} and 
\mycite{saiva_utopia2021}), 
the sigla of the manuscripts
used are made up of a letter signifying the script (e.g.~`N' for
Nepālākṣara/Newari), a superscript letter for the current location where
the manuscript is deposited (e.g.~`C' for Cambridge), and two (sometimes
only one or even three) subscript digits echoing the last digit(s) of
the reference number of the manuscript in the library where it is
located or, in the case of NGMPP reel numbers, the last two digits of
the first part of the reel number. For details of this system and for
the underlying reasons, see 
\mycitep{bisschop_universal_2018}{50--51}. 
Since in the case of the Vṛṣasārasaṃgraha all available manuscripts use some variant
of the Nepālākṣara script, in this publication I have left the first
letter out, making the letter for the current location non-superscript.
This keeps the apparatus more readable. In the manuscript descriptions
below, I give this implied `N' in brackets as a reminder.

\subsection{The Cambridge Manuscripts}

\noindent
\mysubsubsection{(N)C$_{94}$}{nc94}
Cambridge University Library, Add. 1694.1. Fully collated for chapters
1--12 of the critical edition in this volume. See a detailed description
of this manuscript at the CUL online catalogue.\footnote{https://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/view/MS-ADD-01694-00001/382}
According to this catalogue, the date of creation of this manuscript 
is the 12th century, its dimensions are 5 × ca. 53.5 cm. The script is
Nepālākṣara. It is a palm-leaf multiple-text manuscript containing 258
folios and transmitting eight texts: 
1) \skttitle{Śivadharmaśāstra}{Sivadharmasastra} 
2) \skttitle{Śivadharmottara}{Sivadharmottara} 
3) \skttitle{Śivadharmasaṃgraha}{Sivadharmasamgraha} 
4) \skttitle{Umāmaheśvarasaṃvāda}{Umamahesvarasamvada} 
5) \skttitle{Uttarottaramahāsaṃvāda}{Uttarottaramahasamvada} 
6) \skttitle{Vṛṣasārasaṃgraha}{Vrsasarasamgraha}
7) \skttitle{Dharmaputrikā}{Dharmaputrika} 
8) \skttitle{Śivopaniṣad}{Sivopanisad}.

The VSS occupies 45 folios: it starts on f.~193 (the recto side, online
image no. 381, is an empty folio side, the text itself starts on the
verso side); it ends on f.~239r (and not 193r, as the online description
says; online image no. 472). The text of the VSS is transmitted fully,
without any folios or major sections of the text missing. The leaves
transmitting the VSS are well-preserved. Some folio sides are faded and
most folios are somewhat damaged on the right side, sometimes at other parts, and it seems from the images that some opaque-looking tape has been applied to protect these damaged sections. 
In my critical edition
the broken off, completely lost, \emph{akṣara}s are represented by ×,
the illegible \emph{akṣara}s under the tape by ¤ (`illegible'). The
quality of the readings of this manuscript is one of the best,
comparable only to msNa and msP, making it one of the most important
sources for the VSS.


\mysubsubsection{(N)C$_{45}$}{nc45}
Cambridge University Library, Add. 1645. Fully collated for chapters
1--12 of the critical edition in this volume. See a detailed description
of this manuscript at the CUL online catalogue.\footnote{https://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/view/MS-ADD-01645/404}
According to this catalogue, the dimensions of the manuscript are 4.4cm
× 61.7cm. The manuscript is dated to (Nepali) `\emph{samvat} 259
\emph{śrāvaṇa śukla dvādaśiyādi}(?) \textless{} \emph{trayodaśyām},'
which converts to July 10/11 Monday/Tuesday, 1139 CE.\footnote{F. 247r
  line 6. The Cambridge site transcribes this colophon as: \emph{saṃvat}
  259 \emph{śrāvaṇaśukladvādaśi{[}pyaḍi} 8 \emph{trayodaśyāṃ} (retrived
  8 Dec 2021). The element \emph{dvādaśipyaḍi} might be read as
  \emph{dvādaśiyā} \emph{di}, perhaps a mistake for \emph{dvādaśyāṃ}
  \emph{di} (\emph{di} for a misplaced \emph{diva/divā}?), and the
  symbol that does look like a figure `8' of a slightly later period
  than the manuscript itself (resembling the mathematical symbol
  \textless{}) might also be a \emph{kākapada}. Another faint
  \emph{kākapada} is perhaps to be seen under \emph{daśi}, therefore it
  is possible that the scribe's intention was to delete \emph{dvādaśi}°
  and correct it to \emph{trayodaśyām}, and then the date becomes the
  11th of July. Kengo Harimoto has suggested that the unclear element
  (\emph{yādi/pyaḍi}) is in fact \emph{ghaṭi}, and after comparing these
  two syllables to other instances of \emph{gha} and \emph{ṭa}, one
  could not be agree. In this case this should be an indication of the
  exact time the scribe finished copying the text. It is still not clear
  if we should take \emph{dvādaśi} or \emph{trayodaśyām} as the date.
  For help on the conversion of the date and for a detailed discussion
  on the colophon I am indebted to Kengo Harimoto.} The script is
Nepālākṣara. It is a palm-leaf multiple-text manuscript containing 247
folios. Eight texts are transmitted in this manuscript: 1)
Śivadharmaśāstra 2) Śivadharmottara 3) Śivadharmasaṃgraha 4) Śivopaniṣad
5) Umāmaheśvarasaṃvāda 6) Uttarottaramahāsaṃvāda 7) Vṛṣasārasaṃgraha 8)
Dharmaputrikā.

The VSS occupies 37 folios plus one folio side: it starts on f.~201v
line 4 (online image no. 404), it ends on f.~238v line 3 (online image
no. 478). The readings of this manuscript seem to follow those of msNa
remarkably closely transmitting the Śivadharmottara (as observed by De
Simini and Harimoto)\footnote{Personal communication, 1 Dec 2021.}. This
is more difficult to see in the VSS, but indeed, they seem closely
related. CHECK MORE on this


\mysubsubsection{(N)C$_{02}$}{nc02}
Cambridge University Library, Add.\thinspace 2102. 
Palm-leaf, 96 folios. Fully
collated all available folios for chapters 1--12 of the critical edition
in this volume. See a detailed description of this manuscript at the CUL
online catalogue.\footnote{https://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/view/MS-ADD-02102/181}
According to this catalogue site, the date of creation is the 12th
century, the dimensions of the manuscript are 4.8cm × ca. 52.5cm. The
script is Nepālākṣara. It is a palm-leaf multiple-text manuscript
containing 96 folios. Six texts are transmitted in this manuscript: 1)
Śivadharmottara 2) Śivadharmasaṃgraha 3) Umāmaheśvarasaṃvāda 4)
Śivopaniṣad 5) Vṛṣasārasaṃgraha 6) Dharmaputrikā (only fol.~322v).

The Vṛṣasārasaṃgraha starts on f.~267r line 1\footnote{Not on f.~237r as
  the online description claims. This first folio in fact has no visible
  foliation.} (online image 181) in a hand which is different from the
rest of the manuscript, but it changes back in the next folio.\footnote{Cf.
  the metadata on the CUL site: `1 folio of the same dimensions is a
  modern supply for the beginning of the \emph{Vṛṣasārasaṃgraha}.' A
  hardly readable note in pencil to the same effect is visible at the
  top of the first folio side (f.~267r, `mode\ldots{}\ldots{} supply beg
  of Vṛṣasāra-saṃgr.'). I am not sure how `modern' this supplement is,
  but it seems indeed likely that a lost first folio was supplemented
  with a later copy. To match the end of this new copy with the
  beginning of the next, older, folio, a scribe more or less erased the
  beginning of the first line in the old folio, rather than the other
  way round. This slightly illogical decision may mean that the younger
  copy was not tailor-made for the old portion, but rather that it was
  taken from a younger manuscript which was perhaps considered more
  legible. Otherwise it would have been more practical to stop copying
  the first folio at the point where the next begins. (The folio coming
  before this supplement, image no. 180, ends with verse 7.122cd of the
  \emph{Śivopaniṣad}: \emph{yauvanasthā gṛhasthāś ca}
  {[}\emph{prāsā}{]}\emph{dasthāś ca ye nṛpāḥ}.)}

In this multiple-text manuscript, the VSS is trasmitted in an incomplete
form, that is to say, a number of folios are missing (most notably
chapters 15--17). The first partially visible folio number is in image
184: the numeral characters 200+60 are visible (268v, according to the
CUL online catalogue). In image 186, the folio number 269 is clearly
visible (f.~269v). In folio 270v, the continuous text is broken at verse
2.21c (\emph{kāmarū°}), folios 271 and 272 are missing, and the text
resumes on folio 273r with verse 3.30b ({[}\emph{ahiṃsā
pa}{]}\emph{ramaṃ} \emph{sukham}). Folio 291 is missing (verses
12.87cd--12.113). In folio 296v (image no. 234) the text breaks off
again at \emph{vātaśūlair upadrutā} \textbar{} \emph{śukro} (verse 14.XX
CHECK), the next folio being 306r (\emph{carmatāś ca dvijasundarīṣu})
(verse 18.XX CHECK) (nine folios and chapters 15--17 are completely
missing).

Again, there are two missing folios after \emph{bandhus sarvva°} in
verse 18.XX CHECK in f.~306v. The text resumes in folio 309r (image 237)
with \emph{°ṇeṣu ca sarvveṣu vidvān sreṣṭha sa ucyate} (verse 19.XX
CHECK). Another folio is missing between \emph{iṣṭāniṣṭadvaya°} (verse
20.XX CHECK, folio 309v) and \emph{snāyu majjā sirā tathā} (verse 20.XX
CHECK, folio 311r). The VSS ends on folio 322v (image no. 262) with the
concluding colophon \emph{vṛṣasārasaṅgraha samāpta iti}. This folio also
contains the beginning of the \emph{Dharmaputrikā}, but this
multiple-text manuscript contains no more folios.

NGMPP A 1082/3, NAK 3/393. Fully collated for chapters 1--12 of the
critical edition in this volume. See a brief description of this MS in
the NGMCP online catalogue.\footnote{https://catalogue.ngmcp.uni-hamburg.de/receive/aaingmcp\_ngmcpdocument\_00098499}
According to this catalogue, the dimensions of the manuscript are 55.6cm × 5.5cm. Dated to NS 189 (1068--69 CE).\footnote{F. 12r line 2 of the
  \emph{Dharmaputrikā}: \emph{navottarāsītiyute sate bde āsāḍhaśuklasya

  of {[}the month{]} Āṣādha.' She adds that the date is verified in
  Petech 1984, 46 as May 24, 1069 CE.} The script is Nepālākṣara. It is
a palm-leaf multiple-text manuscript containing 274 folios. Eight texts
are transmitted in this manuscript: 1) Śivadharmaśāstra 2)
Śivadharmottara 3) Śivadharmasaṃgraha 4) Umāmaheśvarasaṃvāda 5)
Śivopaniṣad 6) Vṛṣasārasaṃgraha 7) Dharmaputrikā 8)
Uttarottaramahāsaṃvāda.

As for each text in this collection, the foliation for the
Vṛṣasārasaṃgraha restarts from f.~1v (f.~1r is a cover) and the text
spans fols.~1v--46r. This is a beautifully written and well-preserved
manuscript which gives very useful readings and has proved to be
essential for the reconstruction of the Vṛṣasārasaṃgraha.


\mysubsubsection{(N)K$_{10}$}{nk10}
NGMPP A 10/5, NAK 1/1261. Fully collated for chapters 1--12 of the
critical edition in this volume. See a brief description of this MS in
the NGMCP online catalogue.\footnote{https://catalogue.ngmcp.uni-hamburg.de/receive/aaingmcp\_ngmcpdocument\_00085264}
According to this catalogue, the dimensions of the manuscript are 55 x
5.5cm. Undated. It is a palm-leaf multiple-text manuscript containing 74
folios. Four text are transmitted in this manuscript: 1) Śivadharmottara
2) Umāmaheśvarasaṃvāda 3) Śivopaniṣad 4) Vṛṣasārasaṃgraha.

Some folios feature monochrome drawings. A great number of the leaves
that transmit the VSS are damaged and, at least judging from the
microfilm images, faded and slightly disordered. The folio numbers are
rarely visible. The VSS starts on exp. 44 (upper leaf, no folio number
is visible here). It continues on the lower leaf and then on the upper
leaf on exp. 43 (going backwards) up to 1.62 (\emph{viṃśakoṭiṣu gulmeṣu
ūrdhva°}). Verses 1.62cd--2.22 seem to be missing. The lower leaf on
exp. 43 contains verses 2.23--2.39. The single leaf in exp. 42 contains
verses 2.40--3.16a. Exp. 41 contains a single leaf of the
\emph{Umāmaheśvarasaṃvāda}, ending in a colophon for its chapter
twenty-two, and still going backwards, the preceding folios continue
transmitting the \emph{Umāmaheśvarasaṃvāda}. Exploring the presence of
the VSS in this manuscript further, one should look at the expositions
after no. 44. Exp. 45 contains the end of the \emph{Śivopaniṣad}. The
single leaf on exp. 46 is almost illegible but most probably contains a
fragment of the \emph{Gautamadharmasūtra}. The second line just above
the string hole on the left reads \emph{\ldots{} vīrud vanaspatīnāṃ ca
puṣpāṇi svavad} \emph{ādadīte\ldots{}}, which is a fragment of
\emph{Gautamadharmasūtra} 2.3.25 (12.28). The remaining parts of the VSS
are to be found on exp. 47ff. The upper leaf on exp. 47 continues with
VSS 3.16b-36ab, while the lower leaf contains a text that I have not
been able to identify. The lower leaf in exp. 48 transmits
3.36cd--4.11ab, the upper one 4.11b--30a. The lower leaf in exp. 49
contains 4.30ab--47ab, the upper one 47d--68a. And so on so forth. Thus
when reading the text from these images, after exp. 48, one has to start
with the lower leaf and continue with the upper one.

NGMPP B 7/3 = A 1082/2, NAK 1/1075. Fully collated for chapters 1--12 of
the critical edition in this volume. See a brief description of this MS
in the NGMCP online catalogue.\footnote{https://catalogue.ngmcp.uni-hamburg.de/receive/aaingmcp\_ngmcpdocument\_00062373}
According to this catalogue, the dimensions of the manuscript are 58cm ×
6cm. The script is Nepālākṣara. Dated to NS 290 (1169--70 CE). It is a
palm-leaf multiple-text manuscript containing 289 folios. Eight texts
are transmitted in this manuscript: 1) Śivadharmaśāstra 2)

Śivopaniṣad 6) Vṛṣasārasaṃgraha 7) Uttarottaramahāsaṃvāda 8)

It is a nicely written manuscript, giving generally good readings. Fols.
209v--264v contain the VSS.

CHECK. See a brief description of this MS in the NGMCP online
catalogue.\footnote{http://catalogue-old.ngmcp.uni-hamburg.de/mediawiki/index.php/A\_3-3\_\%C5\%9Aivadharma
} According to this catalogue, the dimensions of the manuscript are
58.5cm x 5.5cm. The script is Nepālākṣara. Dated to NS 321 (1200--01
CE). It is a palm-leaf multiple-text manuscript containing 215 folios.
Eight texts are transmitted in this manuscript: 1) Śivadharmaśāstra 2)
Śivadharmottara 3) Śivadharmasaṃgraha missing (only a few folios extant,
e.g. ff.~124 and 143) 4) Umāmaheśvarasaṃvāda 5) Śivopaniṣad 6)
Uttarottaramahāsaṃvāda 7) Vṛṣasārasaṅgraha 8) Dharmaputrikā

VSS starts in f.~227 (image no. 177) and seems to end after it begins
transmitting chapter 23 on f.~264 (image no. 218). The microfilm images
are somewhat blurred and the readings do not seem promising.

\subsection{The Paris Manuscript}

\mysubsubsection{(N)P$_{57}$}{np57}
This is a multiple-text palm-leaf manuscript written in 
Nepālākṣara script and preserved in the 
Collection Sylvain Lévi at the Institut d'études
indiennes, Collège de France as MS Skt 57-B 23. 
It contains 249 palm leaves, each folio containing six lines. 
Folios 214 and 216, are missing from the 
part of the manuscript that transmits the VSS,
thus we don't have verses 1.60d--2.21ab, as well as
3.14--42 and 4.1--7.
%also 3, 8, 47, 48, 135, 197, .
%Folio 215v ends with \skt{kautūhalam atī} in 3.14a and the next available folio starts with \skt{tyam iṣṭagatiḥ proktaṃ} in 4.8a. This means that verses 3.14--42 and 4.1--7 of the VSS, altogether 36 verses are missing. This is indeed approximately the number of verses that two folio sides contain.
Foliation is in the verso: on middle of the left-hand margin in
combination of Newari letters and in the middle of right-hand in arabic
numerals by a second hand. 
%There are two binding holes: one in the centre
%left and one in the centre right. 
The manuscript damaged in margins with considerable loss of the text.?? The text is written in a clear hand and contains few mistakes. Although it is undated manuscript, it could be dated to the 11th century AD on palaeographical grounds. It contains the following text in the order they are presented in the manuscript:
Śivadharmaśāstra (fols.~1--40), 
Śivadharmottaraśāstra (fols.~40--93), 
Śivadharmasaṃgraha (fols.~94--142), 
Umāmaheśvarasaṃvāda (fols.~143--172), 
Śivopaniṣad (fols.~173-- 189), 
Uttarottaramahāsaṃvāda (fols. 190--211), 
Vṛṣasārasaṃgraha (fols.~212--252), 
Dharmaputrikā (fols.~253--262). 
This source contains reliable readings and contains
few scribal mistakes.%
	\footnote{This description had as its starting point a
			          shorter description written and 
			          shared with me by Nirajan Kafle.}
%Śivāśramādhyāya covers fols.~33v4--37r3. Nirajan says it reads close to Naraharinātha's edition

- avagrahas usually supplied but sometimes found in the MSS, not used by me for crasis (e.g. a+a=ā)
- daṇḍas: usually 4 pādas to a verse, but I have made arbitrary decisions based on sense-units 
  because none of the sources really indicate where a verse ends (||).
- falsifications everywhere on purpose and accidentally
