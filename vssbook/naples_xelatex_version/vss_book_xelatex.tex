\mychapter{Preface}

\section{Aims and problems}
\frenchspacing

\noindent
What is this edition? It is not much more than
 a new copy, and carefully prepared new version
of a text called \Vss, based on a number of witnesses,
augmented with an analysis of the contents, with
contextualisation, and with an English translation.
As for the critical edition, while I went to great 
lengths to understand the textual history behind 
the manuscripts used, it is obviously a deeply contaminated 
version of a text transmitted through contaminated witnesses.
Nevertheless, it is hopefully a version that is as 
close to the authors' and redactors' original intention
around the time they assembled these chapters together, 
approximately in the seventh to tenth centuries, as possible. 
Of course we do not know if there was a single moment
when the intention to compose a new text on Dharma
under the title \Vss\ was born or if there was one single
`original copy',%
		\footnote{This reminds one of James McLaverty's
				         question (as quoted in 
   				        \mycitep{McGannTextualCondition}{??}):
				``If the Mona Lisa is in the Louvre in Paris, where is Hamlet?''}
but it is hopefully the most meaningful and most readable
among all available copies. Still, the present book is just a
version of a text that surely has never existed exactly 
in this very form, inevitably showing
signs of being an eclectic edition. 
Furthermore, it may show unintentional 
characteristics of the 21th century 
(ones that go beyond the modern Devanāgarī font face
or occasional choices based on our modern understandings and
misunderstandings) 
mixed with characteristics of the first millenium. 
We know that `[a]ll editing is an act of interpretation.'% 		
		\footnote{\mycitep{McGannTextualCondition}{??}.}
		\todo{Find a hard copy of McGann's Textual Condition.}
And many of the editorial decisions I made were based
on opinions expressed by colleagues during our
regular reading sessions. Thus this edition is a result
of the interpretative efforts of a group of scholars, and
this may sometimes, but hopefully rarely, have caused contradictions.

And as to complicate things, we are publishing this long text
in two volumes, and the second volume is still in the making
when the first comes out. This may produce various problems:
of interpretation, of internal references, of repetition, 
and most importantly of presenting a text of
embedded and recurring layers cut in half. To counteract
some of these problems, I had finished editing and 
studying some of the most significant passages in 
the second part of the text by the time I let the first one
out of my hands; some of these the reader can find in 
the Appendices. A further minor problem arises when
I discuss topics that I have already touched upon in \mycite{KissVolume2022}: some overlaps are inevitable.

And what is the purpose of this edition? The main 
objective of the \textsc{śiva\-dharma project} 
has been to understand better the function of 
individual texts within the so-called Śivadharma corpus,
and thus the \emph{raison d'être} of the corpus itself. 
My attempt is rather simplistic: it is to understand
what the \Vss\ tried to convey when when it was composed and
to try to see why this text got inserted in those multi-text 
manuscripts that usually transmit the so-called Śivadharma corpus.
But even without this ideal to fully understand the purpose and function 
of the \Vss, to make a pre-eleventh-century
Sanskrit text easily available in the twenty-first century is, I believe, 
a noble aspiration.

\section{Reading the \Vsssc}

\subsection{The title}
The title \Vss\ can be translated as:
`A Compendium on the Essence of the Bull [of Dharma].'
The last two elements (\skt{sāra-saṃgraha}) need
little explanation: this work is a 
`compendium' on, a `collection' or `summary' of (\skt{saṃgraha})
the `essence' (\skt{sāra}) of its topic. The words 
`compendium' and `collection' reflect the composite nature of
the \Vss\ well; see sections on the structure of the text and
on the its possible sources on pp. ??ff and pp. ??ff.
The remaining question is weather the bull in the title 
is only a reference to a representation of Dharma 
or also a hint at Śiva's bull, his vehicle or mount, 
sometimes called Nandi or Nandin in other works.%
		\footnote{There is no trace of Nandi/Nandin 
		as identified with the bull in the \Vss.
		On the possible time after which 
		Nandi or Nandin, originally a \cskt{gaṇa}{gana} 
		was considered a \csindex{bull}, see 
		\mycite{bhattacharya_nandin_1977}.}

Dharma is frequently referred to as a (four-legged) 
bull in Sanskrit literature from at least the time of the \MBh. 
See, e.g., this passage (\MBH\ 3.188.10--13):

\begin{quote}
{\small
  \skt{kṛte \textbf{catuṣpāt} sakalo nirvyājopādhivarjitaḥ} |\\
  \skt{vṛṣaḥ pratiṣṭhito dharmo manuṣyeṣv abhavat purā} || 10 ||\\
  \skt{adharmapādaviddhas tu tribhir aṃśaiḥ pratiṣṭhitaḥ} |\\
  \skt{tretāyāṃ dvāpare 'rdhena vyāmiśro dharma ucyate} || 11 ||\\
  \skt{tribhir aṃśair adharmas tu lokān ākramya tiṣṭhati} |\\
  \skt{caturthāṃśena dharmas tu manuṣyān upatiṣṭhati} || 12 ||\\
  \skt{āyur vīryam atho buddhir balaṃ tejaś ca pāṇḍava} |\\
  \skt{manuṣyāṇām anuyugaṃ hrasatīti nibodha me} || 13 ||\\
  }
\end{quote}

Śiva got his bull, MBh:
13076027a vṛṣabhaṃ ca dadau tasmai saha tābhiḥ prajāpatiḥ
13076027c prasādayām āsa manas tena rudrasya bhārata
13076028a prītaś cāpi mahādevaś cakāra vṛṣabhaṃ tadā
13076028c dhvajaṃ ca vāhanaṃ caiva tasmāt sa vṛṣabhadhvajaḥ
13076029a tato devair mahādevas tadā paśupatiḥ kṛtaḥ
13076029c īśvaraḥ sa gavāṃ madhye vṛṣāṅka iti cocyate


Manusmṛti also confirms this (8.16a): vṛṣo hi bhagavān dharma.

MMW `vṛṣa':\\
``Justice or Virtue personified as a bull or as''Siva's bull Mn. viii,
16 Pur. Kāvyād.; just or virtuous act, virtue, moral merit ``Siś.
Vās.;''

Mahākṣapaṇaka's koṣa (CHECK date), the Anekārthadhvanimañjarī, places
the meaning `dharma' as first when defining the word `vṛṣa':

\begin{quote}
    \skt{dharmo vṛṣo vṛṣaḥ śreṣṭho vṛṣo gaur mūṣiko vṛṣaḥ} |\\
    \skt{vṛṣo balaṃ vṛṣaḥ kāmo vṛṣalo vṛṣa ucyate} || 1.48
    \end{quote}

The ŚDhU also mentions the `Dharma bull':

\begin{quote}
    \skt{īśvarāyatanasyādhaḥ śrīmān dharmavṛṣaḥ sthitaḥ} |\\
    \skt{yatra vīravṛṣas tatra kṣityāṃ gomātaraḥ sthitā} || 12.87
\end{quote}

visnusmrḍn:ViS 86.15a/ vṛṣo hi bhagavān dharmaś catuṣ-pādaḥ prakīrtitaḥ
/

Śivapurāṇa 2.3.40.54--55:

\begin{quote}
\skt{śuddhasphaṭikasaṃkāśo vṛṣabhaḥ sarvasundaraḥ} |\\
\skt{yo dharma ucyate vedaiḥ śāstraiḥ siddhamaharṣibhiḥ} ||\\
\skt{tam ārūḍho mahādevo vṛṣabhaṃ dharmavatsalaḥ} |\\
\skt{śuśubhe 'tīva devarṣisevitaḥ sakalair vrajan} ||
\end{quote}

%On the title, see 
%\mycite{DeSiminiMSSFromNepal2016} (238, n.\thinspace 13):
% `'As noted by \Sanderson\
%{[}\ldots{}{]}, this title can have a double meaning, since the `bull'
%(vṛṣa) is both a synonym of `religious practice' and the traditional
%mount (vāhana) of Śiva. i.e.~Sanderson (Forthc. b), Śaivism and
%Brahmanism. (can't find it)

\mycite{SandersonTolerance2015} (210 n.~136), in general,
on \cskt{vṛṣa}{vrsa} being Dharma, and
on the bull appearing on the coins of the 
Hephthalite Hun Mihirakula in particular says the following: 

\begin{quote}
{\footnotesize
To laud the bull (\cskt{vṛṣa}{vrsa}) 
would be surprising if the intended meaning were 
the bull that is Śiva's mount, but not if the word is intended in its figurative meaning, namely \skt{dharmaḥ}, 
or \skt{sukṛtam} `the virtuous actions [prescribed by
the Veda].' For this meaning of \skt{vṛṣaḥ} see, for example,
Amarasiṃha, \skttitle{Nāmaliṅgānuśāsana}{Nmalinganusasana} 
1.4.25b (\skt{sukṛtam vṛṣaḥ}),
3.3.220 (\skt{sukṛte vṛṣabhe vṛṣaḥ}); 
Halāyudha,
\skttitle{Abhidhānaratnamālā}{Abhidhanaratnamala} 1.125cd (\skt{dharmaḥ puṇyaṃ vṛṣaḥ śreyaḥ
sukṛtaṃ ca samaṃ smṛtam}); 
\skttitle{Manusmṛti}{Manusmrit} 8[.]16a
(\skt{vṛṣo hi bhagavān dharmas}\dots); 
and the Gwalior Museum Stone
Inscription of Pataṅgaśambhu (\mycite{MirashiGwalior1962}), l. 15,
\skt{vṛṣaikaniṣṭho `pi jitasmaro 'pi yaḥ śaṅkaro 'bhūd 
bhuvi ko 'py apūrvvaḥ}, 
concerning the Śaiva ascetic Vyomaśambhu: 
`He was in the
world an extraordinary new Śiva, since he too was 
\skt{vṛṣaikaniṣṭhaḥ}
(`devoted solely to pious observance'; 
in Śiva's case `riding only on the Bull') and he too was 
\skt{jitasmaraḥ} (`one who had defeated sensual
urges'; in Śiva's case `the defeater of the Love god Kāmadeva'). 
This is also the meaning of \skt{vṛṣaḥ} in the title \Vss,
one of the works of the Śivadharma corpus 
(see, e.g., \mycitep{SandersonSaivaLit2014}{p.~2}), i.e., 
`Summary of the Essentials of the [Śiva]dharma'. 
}
\end{quote}

\noindent
In his last sentence here, \Sanderson\ implies that the
\Vss\ is organically part of the teachings that we call
the Śivadharma corpus, and thus he adds Śiva in
square brackets when translating the title 
\Vss. A closer examination of the \VSS\ 
reveals no direct references to either Śiva's bull or
to the bull as embodying the Śivadharma. Instead, the bull
in the \VSS\ is repeatedly associated with the Dharma that
is the four \asrama s (see p. \pageref{bullasfourasramas}).
My conclusion is that while the word \skt{vṛṣa} in the
title may well carry a reference to Śiva's bull, it is always
only implied and never explicitely taught, while the bull as
the personification of Dharma as the four
\asrama s explicitely appears. Thus
the title actually lacks any explicit hint to Śaivism, which
fits in well with the rather blurred and multi-layered 
affiliation of the text to Dharmaśāstra, Vaiṣṇavism and Śaivism.%
		\footnote{See also \mycitep{BakkerWorld2014}{69}, who 
			while discussing a seal of Śarvavarman that 
			features a beautifully carved bull representing Dharma,
			remarks: `The reader may also see in the 
			image the thriving Śaiva religion, represented
			by the Bull, the vāhana of Śiva [\dots]'} 





\citeauthor{bhattacharya_nandin_1977} (\citeyear{bhattacharya_nandin_1977}, {1552}) suggests that

\begin{quote}
In the Purāṇas the bull 
(Vṛṣabha\index{vrsabha@\skt{vṛṣabha}} or 
Vṛṣa\index{vrsa@\skt{vṛṣa}}) 
of Śiva is identified with Dharma, ``virtue personified''. 
This is a new development to sanctify the animal 
vehicle of the god. This new situation took place with the religious 
rite when an offering of a bull to a Brahmin deemed to be
of a high religious merit.
\end{quote}

\noindent
Is he ignoring the fact that Dharma as
a bull appears already in the \MBh?
He comes to the conclusion 
(\mycitep{bhattacharya_nandin_1977}{1555})
that one of the earliest sources to fuse the figures
of Nandin and the bull is the relatively early%
		\footnote{See \mycitep{RocherPuranas1986}{199}.}
\MatsP.


\mysubsubsection{Vṛṣadeva's commission?}{vrsadevas-commission}
As a fanciful experiment, and if one supposes that the 
\VSS\ originated in Nepal, one could wonder if the 
title \Vss\ has anything to do with the Licchavi king
Vṛṣadeva.
\citeauthor{SandersonSaivaAge} 
(\citeyear{SandersonSaivaAge}, 74) mentions that  
Vṛṣadeva is `described in an inscription of his eighth-century 
descendant Jayadeva as having inclined towards Buddhism;'
(\mycitep{Vajracarya1973}{148, l. 9}: 
\skt{sugataśāsanapakṣapātī}) 
`a view conﬁrmed by a local chronicle, which attributes to
him the establishing of Buddhist images,'
%fn: Lévi 1990, vol. 2, p. 98.
and that this king established 
`the Caitya of the Sı̄nagu-vihāra (the Svayambhūnāth Caitya).'
More importantly, Sanderson summarises the 
information to be found in the 
Changu Narayana Pillar Inscription (east shaft),%
		\footnote{Gnoli etc. and 
		https://siddham.network/inscription/in02001/} 
namely that Vṛṣadeva was the great-grandfather of Mānadeva, whose
`dated inscriptions range in date from 459 to 505/6 [\CE]'
(\mycitep{SandersonSaivaAge}{75}).%
	   \footnote{Vṛṣadeva was succeeded by Śaṅkaradeva and
	   		            Dharmadeva.}
This would place 
the reign of Vṛṣadeva around 400 \CE. 
The early fifth century may look too early for the date of composition
of the \Vss, and any connection between this king
and the text is impossible to prove at the moment, 
but it is equally impossible to reject any connection, 
and if there were one, it would give some explanation for the slightly
unusual nature of the title.

\subsection{Interpretation of chapters}

\begin{itemize}

\item
  Chapter 12

  \begin{itemize}
  
  \item
    everybody is donating to everybody,
  \item
    the final donor is Brahmā
  \item
    lot of testing going on in the frame story and also
  \item
    in chapter 12
  \item
    also the disguise thing is recurring: 12.37 and ch 1 and
  \item
    when Viṣṇu reveals his identity
  \end{itemize}

\subsection{The role of the VSS in the Śivadharma corpus}

\begin{itemize}

  general ideas

  \begin{itemize}
  
  \item
    is this text really Śaiva? why in this collection?
  \item
    niśvāsa as sadāśiva in ch.~16; Niśvāsa uttarasūtra 5.50-51; see also
    Kafle Niśvāsamukha p.11ff; ibid. p.12: ``The term niśvāsa means
    sighing. Thus, an alternative meaning of the Niśvāsatattvasaṃhitā
    could also be a ``sighing tantra.'' To be more precise, a tantra
    that originated from the sighing of Śiva. This is to say, the speech
    of Śiva.''
  \item
    tattva-system: mati and suśira (ch.~20)
  \item
    parallels: MBh, Bṛhatkālottara,
  \item
    ch.~21: Viṣṇu; is this a Śaiva text?
  \item
    āśramas are in an order different from usual; compare this to NĀT;
    ``Variations on the āśrama-system''

    Śankara But the chapters in Āpastamba follow the traditional order.
    ``Āp. places the householder first among the āśramas, probably on
    account of the importance of that stage to all other āśramas.'' Kane

  \end{enumerate}
\item
  ibid p.~417: person in last āśrama is called: parivrāṭ,
  parivrājaka(!), bhikṣu, muni, yati. See Olivelle, Patrick. The Āśrama
  System. The History and Hermeneutics of a Religious Institution. New
  York, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1993. {[}megvan{]} p.82ff: The
  Order of Āśramas; ibid: ``In later texts the usual order is student,
  householder, hermit, and renouncer, reflecting the sequence of the
  passage from one \emph{āśrama} to another\ldots{} In the Dharmasūtras,
  however, only Baudhāyana and Vasiṣṭha follow that order\ldots{} A
  specific order becomes insignificant when the \emph{āśramas} are taken
  as four alternative adult vocations.'' Are they alternative adult
  vocations here in the Vṛṣasārasaṃgraha? They are numbered.

\subsection{Notes on the language}

\noindent
The language of the VSS goes beyond the idiosyncrasies of epic Sanskrit.
It exhibits strong similarities to Śaiva Aiśa Sanskrit,% 
		\footnote{See Goodall, Törzsök, Hatley, Kiss, Meyr?} 
and it applies particular metrical licences and 
uses a special vocabulary, morphology and syntax.
The analysis of this language, ideally, could lead us to the 
author(s) or redactors of the text and to its
place of composition. Here I only give a brief overview of the most
important phenomena. For details see the observatoins 
on the constitution of the Sanskrit text in the footnotes 
to the translation (pp. ??), as well as the Index.


\subsubsection{Metre}
As regards metrical licences, the first striking feature is the generous
use of the poetic licence sometimes labelled `muta cum
liquida,'\footnote{For recent contributions on this phenomenon, see
  e.g.~Ranjan Sen 2006 (discussing it as appearing in Latin) and Balogh
  2018, note 6 (discussing Sanskrit metre).} namely that some consonant
clusters that would normally turn the previous short (laghu) syllable
long (guru) may in some cases do not do so. The syllables pra, bra, hra,
kra, especially at the beginning of words CHECK, are well-known
candidates for this licence.\footnote{See e.g.~Apte' XXX Dictionary
  Appendix A p.~1. ADD real life examples.} In the VSS, tra, vra, śra,
pra, and also śya, śva, sva, dva, all involving conjunct consonants with
a liquid sounds or semi-vowels in second position, and possibly also
rpa,CHECK! seem additional ones.

The well-known author on prosody, Kedārabhaṭṭa (11-12th centuries),%
		\footnote{SOURCE}	 
frequently quoted by Mallinātha, gives the following definition in his
\skttitle{Vṛttaratnākara}{Vrttaratnakara} (here given together with Sulhaṇa's \skttitle{Sukavihṛdayanandinī}{Sukavihrdayanandini} commentary):

\begin{quote}

\emph{puraḥsthitena tena syāl laghutā 'pi kvacid guroḥ}

\end{quote}

\textbar{}\textbar{} 10 \textbar{}\textbar{} \emph{tatra gra-saṃyogena

\end{quote}
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
\emph{taruṇaṃ sarṣapaśākaṃ navaudanaṃ picchalāni ca dadhīni}
\textbar{}\\
\emph{alpavyayena sundari grāmyajano miṣṭam aśnāti} \textbar{}\textbar{}
1.11 \textbar{}\textbar{}
\end{quote}

TRANSLATE the whole passage!

\begin{quote}
In this {[}work{]}, a consonant cluster at the beginning of a word is
called krama. A {[}preceding{]} long syllable can sometimes be turned
short by that initial {[}syllable{]}.
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
\begin{quote}
\begin{quote}
   ... TRANSLATE 
\end{quote}
\end{quote}
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
Tender mustard seed, fresh porridge, and slimy curds: village people eat
this kind of dishes, O beautiful goddess, due to lack of money.
\end{quote}

To sum this example up: the verse given above (1.11) is in āryā, and the
metric pattern of the second half-verse is the following: - - . - . - .
- - . . - - . - - - This yields 28 morae, instead of the expected 27. By
treating the final syllable of sundari short, in spite of the following
grā, the pattern conforms to the expected pattern: - - . - . - . . - . .
- - . - - -

The commentator gives several more examples (involving the syllables
gra, hra, bhra), including this Śārdūla line:

\begin{quote}
nidravyo hriyam eti hrīparigataḥ prabhraśyate tejasaḥ
\end{quote}

In this line, the last syllable of eti should count as short, in spite
of the fact that the beginning of the next word (hrī°) would normally
turn it long.

The VSS abounds in this phenomenon of `muta cum liquida'. EXAMPLES from
the VSS and from my emendations. CHECK

\begin{itemize}
\item
  only beginning of words in the VSS?
\item
  final -am etc. counts as long (reverse of muta cum liquida)
\item
  In Kannada and Telugu prosody, under the name of śithila-dvitva, the
  exception is that sometimes in a consonant cluster of the form
  {[}consonant + ``r''{]}, the ``r'' (repha) can be ignored, so that it
  is not a conjunct consonant anymore.
\item
  The exception is not accepted by purists: Shatavadhani Ganesh says
  that the Sanskrit masters like Kālidāsa, Bhāravi, Māgha, Śrīharṣa, and
  Viśākhadatta have not freely used this exception (though the masters
  in Kannada and other languages have). Being more of a ``poetic
  licence'' and a violation of the standard rule (only found in later
  poetry), it is extremely unlikely that any sane poet would have
  indulged in that exception in all four pāda-s of a verse. Thus it is
  very unlikely that the program will miss identifying a verse that
  indulges in this

  thread started by Vishvas Vasuki:

\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Vocabulary}

\begin{itemize}

\item
  Special vocabulary/language: karhacit, hṛdi as nominative 10.27cd,
  tirya, me as mayā, āhūtaplavana
\item
  generate list from index
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Number and gender}

\begin{itemize}

\item
  Number: singular next to numerals, and general confusion (CHECK)
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Syntax}

\begin{itemize}

\item
  Special structures: caturmaunasya vakṣyāmi indreṇāsmi phalaṃ dattaṃ
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Stem form nouns}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  stem form nouns (prātipadika)
\item
  a more or less full collation is important: we cannot automatically
  reject `ungrammatical' or unmetrical forms because they may well be
  the `original' one
