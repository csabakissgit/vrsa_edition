First of all, I am grateful to Florinda De Simini for
encouraging me to apply for a position in her 
\textsc{\hbox{śivadharma} project} (ERC no.\thinspace 803624),
for sharing all the relevant manuscript material with me, 
giving invaluable advice whenever needed, and in general
leading the project in the most friendly and
generous way through happy times as well as 
difficult Covid-affected years. 
While working on the \Vss, I was also affiliated with 
another ERC project, the \textsc{dharma project} (ERC no.\thinspace 809994).
I am grateful to all my colleagues involved in that endeavour,
including Arlo Griffith, Emmanuel Francis, Annette Schmiedchen, 
Astrid Zotter, and Dániel Balogh.

As always, I must express my gratitude to my former supervisor,
Alexis Sanderson, and to Dominic Goodall and 
Harunaga Isaacson, for initiating me into Sanskrit philology and
the study of Śaivism.

My colleagues and friends working in Naples or visiting for
shorter periods helped me on a daily basis, during our regular reading sessions and countless
other ways. I am thankful to them:

Giulia Buriola, Alessandro Battistini, Lucas den Boer, Torsten Gerloff, Kenji Takahashi, Francesco Sferra, Dorotea Operato, Daniela Cappello,

I am grateful to Daniela Cappello, Marco Franceschini, and Sushmita Das for their great efforts in acquiring manu\-scripts in Calcutta.
