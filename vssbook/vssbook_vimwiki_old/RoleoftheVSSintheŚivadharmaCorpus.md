The role of the VSS in the Śivadharma corpus
--------------------------------------------

<!-- Back to Introduction.md -->

- general ideas
    - is this text really Śaiva? why in this collection?
    - niśvāsa as sadāśiva in ch. 16; Niśvāsa uttarasūtra 5.50-51; see also Kafle Niśvāsamukha p.11ff; ibid. p.12: "The term niśvāsa             means sighing. Thus, an alternative
            meaning of the Niśvāsatattvasaṃhitā could also be a ‘‘sighing tantra.’’ To be more precise,
            a tantra that originated from the sighing of Śiva. This is to say, the speech of Śiva."
    - tattva-system: mati and suśira (ch. 20)
    - parallels: MBh, Bṛhatkālottara, 
    - ch. 21: Viṣṇu; is this a Śaiva text?
    - āśramas are in an order different from usual; compare this to NĀT; "Variations on the āśrama-system"

- History of Dharmasastra 2.1 pp. 416ff on āśramas

- n. 988! see Āpastamba-dharma-sūtra ii.9.21.1: catvāra āśramā gārhasthyam ācāryakulaṃ maunaṃ vānaprasthyam iti| Quoted by Śankara
    But the chapters in Āpastamba follow the traditional order.  "Āp. places
    the householder first among the āśramas, probably on account of the
    importance of that stage to all other āśramas." Kane ibid.

- ibid p. 417: person in last āśrama is called: parivrāṭ, parivrājaka(!), bhikṣu, muni, yati.
    See Olivelle, Patrick. The Āśrama System. The History and Hermeneutics of a
    Religious Institution. New York, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1993.
    [megvan] p.82ff: The Order of Āśramas; ibid: "In later texts the usual
    order is student, householder, hermit, and renouncer, reflecting the
    sequence of the passage from one _āśrama_ to another... In the
    Dharmasūtras, however, only Baudhāyana and Vasiṣṭha follow that order... A
    specific order becomes insignificant when the _āśramas_ are taken as four
    alternative adult vocations." Are they alternative adult vocations here in
    the Vṛṣasārasaṃgraha? They are numbered.

            ``The full text of the corpus was first published by Naraharinātha
            in 1998, while over the past few years several scholars have
            started to work on individual parts of the corpus or referred to
            them in their studies. See, in particular, Acharya 2009; Bisschop
            2010, 2014; De Simini 2013, 2016a, 2016b, 2017; De Simini & Mirnig
            2017; Goodall 2011; Kafle 2013, 2015; Magnone 2005; Sanderson
            2003/04, 2012/13; Schwartz 2012. An edition of the Śivadharmaśāstra
            alone, based on a single manuscript in the Adyar Library, has been
            published more recently as well (Jugnu & Sharma 2014). The
            Śivopaniṣad, which also forms part of the Śivadharma corpus, was
            already published much earlier but was not recognised as such,
            being included in a collection of Upaniṣads (Kunhan Raja 1933).''

- Vipula
    
    Vipula in the MBh:

	MBh 13040016aff

	Devaśarman and his wife Ruci
	13040017a tasya rūpeṇa --> 13040017a tasyā rūpeṇa

        all gods, esp. Indra, are in love with her but Devaśarman guards her
        wants to perform yajña: how to guard her during the ritual?  calls his
        pupil, Vipula tells him that Indra can assume various forms Vipula
        decides that the only way to protect her from Indra is to magically
        'enter' her (with yoga) he tells her stories and enters her 

        MBh 13041001ff Indra sees the opportunity and enters the āśrama as a
        beautiful man he sees Vipula's lifeless body Ruci fancies Indra, but
        Vipula in his body stops her from standing up Indra sings to her
        beautiful songs he says "I have come for you, I am Devendra, I am in
        love" Vipula stops her from doing anything Indra is a bit shocked by
        her not being moved, gets angry and can see now that Vipula is in her
        Vipula leaves her, enters his own body, and abuses Indra and tells
        Indra how wicked he is Indra is ashamed and disappears Devaśarman
        returns to the āśrama, Vipula tells him what happened and Devaśarman
        praises him
