<p>Cambridge University Library, Add. 1694.1. Fully collated for chapters 1–12 of the critical edition in this volume. See a detailed description of this manuscript at the CUL online catalogue.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> According to this catalogue, the date of creation is the 12th century, the dimensions of the manuscript are 5cm × ca. 53.5cm. The script is Nepālākṣara. It is a palm-leaf multiple-text manuscript containing 258 folios. Eight texts are transmitted in this manuscript: 1) Śivadharmaśāstra 2) Śivadharmottara 3) Śivadharmasaṃgraha 4) Umāmaheśvarasaṃvāda 5) Uttarottaramahāsaṃvāda 6) Vṛṣasārasaṃgraha 7) Dharmaputrikā 8) Śivopaniṣad.</p>
<p>The VSS occupies 45 folios: it starts on f. 193 (the recto side, online image no. 381, is an empty folio side, the text itself starts on the verso side); it ends on f. 239r (and not 193r, as the online description says; online image no. 472). The text of the VSS is transmitted fully, without any folios or major sections of the text missing. The leaves transmitting the VSS are well-preserved. Some folio sides are faded and most folios are somewhat damaged on the right side, sometimes at other parts, and it seems from the images that some opaque-looking tape has been applied to protect these damaged sections. In my critical edition the broken off, completely lost, <em>akṣara</em>s are represented by ×, the illegible <em>akṣara</em>s under the tape by ¤ (‘illegible’). The quality of the readings of this manuscript is one of the best, comparable only to msNa and msP, making it one of the most important sources for the VSS. <!-- ayutaif msCa 1.53d --></p>

<p>Cambridge University Library, Add. 1645. Fully collated for chapters 1–12 of the critical edition in this volume. See a detailed description of this manuscript at the CUL online catalogue.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> According to this catalogue, the dimensions of the manuscript are 4.4cm × 61.7cm. The manuscript is dated to (Nepali) ‘<em>samvat</em> 259 <em>śrāvaṇa śukla dvādaśiyādi</em>(?) &lt; <em>trayodaśyām</em>,’ which converts to July 10/11 Monday/Tuesday, 1139 CE.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> The script is Nepālākṣara.

<p>The VSS occupies 37 folios plus one folio side: it starts on f. 201v line 4 (online image no. 404), it ends on f. 238v line 3 (online image no. 478). The readings of this manuscript seem to follow those of msNa remarkably closely transmitting the Śivadharmottara (as observed by De Simini and Harimoto.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> This is more difficult to see in the VSS, but indeed, they seem closely related.

<p>Cambridge University Library, Add. 2102. Palm-leaf, 96 folios. Fully collated all available folios for chapters 1–12 of the critical edition in this volume. See a detailed description of this manuscript at the CUL online catalogue.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> According to this catalogue site, the date of creation is the 12th century, the dimensions of the manuscript are 4.8cm × ca. 52.5cm. The script is Nepālākṣara. It is a palm-leaf multiple-text manuscript containing 96 folios. Six texts are transmitted in this manuscript: 1) Śivadharmottara 2) Śivadharmasaṃgraha 3) Umāmaheśvarasaṃvāda 4) Śivopaniṣad 5) Vṛṣasārasaṃgraha 6) Dharmaputrikā (only fol. 322v).</p>
<p>The Vṛṣasārasaṃgraha starts on f. 267r line 1<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> (online image 181) in a hand which is different from the rest of the manuscript, but it changes back in the next folio.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>In this multiple-text manuscript, the VSS is trasmitted in an incomplete form, that is to say, a number of folios are missing (most notably chapters 15–17). The first partially visible folio number is in image 184: the numeral characters 200+60 are visible (268v, according to the CUL online catalogue). In image 186, the folio number 269 is clearly visible (f. 269v). In folio 270v, the continuous text is broken at verse 2.21c (<em>kāmarū°</em>), folios 271 and 272 are missing, and the text resumes on folio 273r with verse 3.30b ([<em>ahiṃsā pa</em>]<em>ramaṃ</em> <em>sukham</em>). In folio 296v (image no. 234) the text breaks off again at <em>vātaśūlair upadrutā</em> | <em>śukro</em> (verse 14.XX CHECK), the next folio being 306r (<em>carmatāś ca dvijasundarīṣu</em>) (verse 18.XX CHECK) (nine folios and chapters 15–17 are completely missing).</p>
<p>Again, there are two missing folios after <em>bandhus sarvva°</em> in verse 18.XX CHECK in f. 306v. The text resumes in folio 309r (image 237) with <em>°ṇeṣu ca sarvveṣu vidvān sreṣṭha sa ucyate</em> (verse 19.XX CHECK). Another folio is missing between <em>iṣṭāniṣṭadvaya°</em> (verse 20.XX CHECK, folio 309v) and <em>snāyu majjā sirā tathā</em> (verse 20.XX CHECK, folio 311r). The VSS ends on folio 322v (image no. 262) with the concluding colophon <em>vṛṣasārasaṅgraha samāpta iti</em>. This folio also contains the beginning of the <em>Dharmaputrikā</em>, but this multiple-text manuscript contains no more folios.</p>

<li id="fn3"><p>F. 247r line 6. The Cambridge site transcribes this colophon as: <em>saṃvat</em> 259 <em>śrāvaṇaśukladvādaśi[pyaḍi</em> 8 <em>trayodaśyāṃ</em> (retrived 8 Dec 2021). The element <em>dvādaśipyaḍi</em> might be read as <em>dvādaśiyā</em> <em>di</em>, perhaps a mistake for <em>dvādaśyāṃ</em> <em>di</em> (<em>di</em> for a misplaced <em>diva/divā</em>?), and the symbol that does look like a figure ‘8’ of a slightly later period than the manuscript itself (resembling the mathematical symbol &lt;) might also be a <em>kākapada</em>. Another faint <em>kākapada</em> is perhaps to be seen under <em>daśi</em>, therefore it is possible that the scribe’s intention was to delete <em>dvādaśi</em>° and correct it to <em>trayodaśyām</em>, and then the date becomes the 11th of July. Kengo Harimoto has suggested that the unclear element (<em>yādi/pyaḍi</em>) is in fact <em>ghaṭi</em>, and after comparing these two syllables to other instances of <em>gha</em> and <em>ṭa</em>, one could not be agree. In this case this should be an indication of the exact time the scribe finished copying the text. It is still not clear if we should take <em>dvādaśi</em> or <em>trayodaśyām</em> as the date. For help on the conversion of the date and for a detailed discussion on the colophon I am indebted to Kengo Harimoto.<a href="#fnref3" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>

<li id="fn7"><p>Cf. the metadata on the CUL site: ‘1 folio of the same dimensions is a modern supply for the beginning of the <em>Vṛṣasārasaṃgraha</em>.’ A hardly readable note in pencil to the same effect is visible at the top of the first folio side (f. 267r, ‘mode…… supply beg of Vṛṣasāra-saṃgr.’). I am not sure how ‘modern’ this supplement is, but it seems indeed likely that a lost first folio was supplemented with a later copy. To match the end of this new copy with the beginning of the next, older, folio, a scribe more or less erased the beginning of the first line in the old folio, rather than the other way round. This slightly illogical decision may mean that the younger copy was not tailor-made for the old portion, but rather that it was taken from a younger manuscript which was perhaps considered more legible. Otherwise it would have been more practical to stop copying the first folio at the point where the next begins. (The folio coming before this supplement, image no. 180, ends with verse 7.122cd of the <em>Śivopaniṣad</em>: <em>yauvanasthā gṛhasthāś ca</em> [<em>prāsā</em>]<em>dasthāś ca ye nṛpāḥ</em>.)<a href="#fnref7" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
