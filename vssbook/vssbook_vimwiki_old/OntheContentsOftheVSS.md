On the title 
------------ 
    
The main question concerning the title Vṛṣasārasaṃgraha ('A
Compendium on the Essence of the Bull [of Dharma]') is
weather the bull in the title is only a reference to a
representation of Dharma or also a hint at Śiva's vehicle,
sometimes named Nandi.

Dharma has frequently been referred to as a bull in Sanskrit
literature from at least the time of the MBh, e.g. in this
passage:

        MBh on the 4-legged bull:
        03188010a kṛte catuṣpāt sakalo nirvyājopādhivarjitaḥ
        03188010c vṛṣaḥ pratiṣṭhito dharmo manuṣyeṣv abhavat purā
        03188011a adharmapādaviddhas tu tribhir aṃśaiḥ pratiṣṭhitaḥ
        03188011c tretāyāṃ dvāpare 'rdhena vyāmiśro dharma ucyate
        03188012a tribhir aṃśair adharmas tu lokān ākramya tiṣṭhati
        03188012c caturthāṃśena dharmas tu manuṣyān upatiṣṭhati
        03188013a āyur vīryam atho buddhir balaṃ tejaś ca pāṇḍava
        03188013c manuṣyāṇām anuyugaṃ hrasatīti nibodha me

Manusmṛti also confirms this (8.16a): vṛṣo hi bhagavān dharma. 

MMW 'vṛṣa':  
"Justice or Virtue personified as a bull or as "Siva's bull Mn. viii, 16 Pur. Kāvyād.;
just or virtuous act, virtue, moral merit "Siś. Vās.;"

Mahākṣapaṇaka's koṣa (CHECK date), the
Anekārthadhvanimañjarī, places the meaning 'dharma' as 
first when defining the word 'vṛṣa':

        dharmo vṛṣo vṛṣaḥ śreṣṭho vṛṣo gaurmūṣiko vṛṣaḥ |
        vṛṣo balaṃ vṛṣaḥ kāmo vṛṣalo vṛṣa ucyate || 1.48
        
The ŚDhU also mentions the 'Dharma bull':

        īśvarāyatanasyādhaḥ śrīmān dharmavṛṣaḥ sthitaḥ ||
        yatra vīravṛṣas tatra kṣityāṃ gomātaraḥ sthitā || 12.87

On the title, see De Simini 2016:238 n. 13: ''As noted by
Sanderson [...], this title can have a double meaning, since
the ‘bull’ (vṛṣa) is both a synonym of ‘religious practice’
and the traditional mount (vāhana) of Śiva.
        i.e. Sanderson (Forthc. b), Śaivism and Brahmanism.
        (can't find it)

Sanderson Tolerance p. 210 n. 136: "[...] To laud the bull (*vṛṣa*) [on the
coins of the Hephthalite Hun Mihirakula, CsK] would be surprising if the intended
meaning were the bull that is Śiva's mount, but not if the word is intended in
its figurative meaning, namely *dharmaḥ*, or *sukṛtam* 'the virtuous actions
[prescribed by the Veda].' For this meaning of *vṛṣaḥ* see, for example,
Amarasiṃha, *Nāmaliṅgānuśāsana* 1.4.25b (*sukṛtam vṛṣaḥ*), 3.3.220 (*sukṛte
vṛṣabhe vṛṣaḥ*); Halāyudha, *Abhidhānaratnamālā* 1.125cd (*dharmaḥ puṇyaṃ vṛṣaḥ
śreyaḥ sukṛtaṃ ca samaṃ smṛtam*); *Manusmṛti* 8[. CsK]16a CHECK (*vṛṣo hi bhagavān
dharmas ...*); and the Gwalior Museum Stone Inscription of Pataṅgaśambhu
(\textsc{Mirashi} 1962), l. 15, *vṛṣaikaniṣṭho 'pi jitasmaro 'pi yaḥ śaṅkaro
'bhūd bhuvi ko 'py apūrvvaḥ,* concerning the Śaiva ascetic Vyomaśambhu: 'He was
in the world an extraordinary new Śiva, since he too was *vṛṣaikaniṣṭhaḥ*
('devoted solely to pious observance'; in Śiva’s case 'riding only on the
Bull') and he too was *jitasmaraḥ* ('one who had defeated sensual urges'; in
Śiva's case 'the defeater of the Love god Kāmadeva').  This is also the meaning
of *vṛṣaḥ* in the title *Vṛṣasārasaṃgraha*, one of the works of the Śivadharma
corpus (see, e.g., \textsc{Sanderson} 2014, p. 2), i.e., 'Summary of the
Essentials of the [Śiva]dharma'."
