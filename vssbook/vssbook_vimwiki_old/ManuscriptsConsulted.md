In the manuscript descriptions below, in addition to some
general remarks, I will mainly focus on information relevant
to the VSS.  For much more detail on the overall features of
these manuscripts, see De Simini 2016 [CHECK SDh MSS from
Nepal] and the catalogues I mention at each individual
manuscript.[^thanksformss]

  [^thanksformss]:
  I owe thanks to Florinda De Simini for sharing with me most of
  the manuscripts listed here, to Kengo Harimoto and Gudrun
  Melzer (Munich) for providing photos of the Munich MS, and
  to Nirajan Kafle for sharing the Paris MS with me.

In recently published and forthcoming critical
editions of and articles on the Śivadharma corpus
(CHECK examples), the sigla of the manuscripts used
are made up of a letter signifying the script (e.g. 'N'
for Nepālākṣara/Newari), a superscript letter for
the current location where the manuscript is deposited
(e.g. 'C' for Cambridge), and two (sometimes only one
or even three) subscript digits echoing the last digit(s)
of the reference number of the manuscript in the library
where it is located or, in the case of NGMPP reel numbers,
the last two digits of the first part of the reel number.
For details of this system and for the underlying reasons,
see Bisschop 2018b, 50--51 (UnivŚ).  Since in the case
of the Vṛṣasārasaṃgraha all available manuscripts
use some variants of the Nepālākṣara script, in this
publication I have left the first letter out, making the
letter for the current location non-superscript. This
makes the apparatus more readable.  In the manuscript
descriptions below, I give this implied 'N' in brackets
as a reminder.
