    On the title, see De Simini 2016:238 n. 13: ''As noted by Sanderson [...], this title can have a double meaning,
    since the â€˜bullâ€™ (vá¹à¤›£a) is both a synonym of â€˜religious practiceâ€™ and the traditional mount (vÄhana) of Åšiva.

** The role of the VSS in the Åšivadharma corpus
*** general ideas
    - is this text really Åšaiva? why in this collection?
    - niÅ›vÄsa as sadÄÃ…›iva in ch. 16; NiÅ›vÄsa uttarasÅ«tra 5.50-51; see also Kafle NiÅ›vÄsamukha p.11ff; ibid. p.12: "The term niÅ›vÄsa             means sighing. Thus, an alternative
            meaning of the NiÅ›vÄsatattvasaá¹ƒhitÄ could also be a â€˜â€˜sighing tantra.â€™â€™ To be more precise,
            a tantra that originated from the sighing of Åšiva. This is to say, the speech of Åšiva."
    - tattva-system: mati and suÅ›ira (ch. 20)
    - parallels: MBh, Bá¹›hatkÄlottara, 
    - ch. 21: Viá¹£á¹‡u; is this a Åšaiva text?
    - ÄÃ…›ramas are in an order different from usual; compare this to NÄ€T; "Variations on the ÄÃ…›rama-system"

    History of Dharmasastra 2.1
    pp. 416ff on ÄÃ…›ramas

    n. 988! see Ä€pastamba-dharma-sÅ«tra ii.9.21.1: catvÄra ÄÃ…›ramÄ gÄrhasthyam ÄcÄryakulaá¹ƒ maunaá¹ƒ vÄnaprasthyam iti| Quoted by Åšankara
    But the chapters in Ä€pastamba follow the traditional order.
    "Ä€p. places the householder first among the ÄÃ…›ramas, probably on account of the importance of that stage to all other ÄÃ…›ramas." Kane ibid.

    ibid p. 417: person in last ÄÃ…›rama is called: parivrÄÃ¡¹­, parivrÄjaka(!), bhiká¹£u, muni, yati.
    See 
    Olivelle, Patrick. The Ä€Å›rama System. The History and Hermeneutics of a Religious Institution. New York, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1993.  [megvan] p.82ff: The Order of Ä€Å›ramas; 
            ibid: "In later texts the usual order is student, householder, hermit, and renouncer, reflecting the sequence of the passage from one _ÄÃ…›rama_ to another... In the DharmasÅ«tras, however, only BaudhÄyana and Vasiá¹£á¹­ha follow that order... A specific order becomes insignificant when the _ÄÃ…›ramas_ are taken as four alternative adult vocations." 
    Are they alternative adult vocations here in the Vá¹à¤›£asÄrasaá¹ƒgraha? They are numbered.

An edition of the ÅšivadharmaÅ›Ästra alone, based on a single manuscript in the Adyar Library, has been published more recently as well (Jugnu & Sharma 2014). The Åšivopaniá¹£ad, which also forms part of the Åšivadharma corpus, was already published much earlier but was not recognised as such, being included in a collection of Upaniá¹£ads (Kunhan Raja 1933).''

*** Vipula
    Vipula in the MBh:

	MBh 13040016aff

	DevaÅ›arman and his wife Ruci
	13040017a tasya rÅ«peá¹‡a --> 13040017a tasyÄ rÅ«peá¹‡a

	all gods, esp. Indra, are in love with her
	but DevaÅ›arman guards her
	wants to perform yajÃ±a: how to guard her during the ritual?
	calls his pupil, Vipula
	tells him that Indra can assume various forms
	Vipula decides that the only way to protect her from Indra is to magically 'enter' her (with yoga)
	he tells her stories and enters her 

	MBh 13041001ff
	Indra sees the opportunity and enters the ÄÃ…›rama as a beautiful man
	he sees Vipula's lifeless body
	Ruci fancies Indra, but Vipula in his body stops her from standing up
	Indra sings to her beautiful songs
	he says "I have come for you, I am Devendra, I am in love"
	Vipula stops her from doing anything
	Indra is a bit shocked by her not being moved, gets angry and can see now that Vipula is in her
	Vipula leaves her, enters his own body, and abuses Indra and tells Indra how wicked he is
	Indra is ashamed and disappears
	DevaÅ›arman returns to the ÄÃ…›rama, Vipula tells him what happened and DevaÅ›arman praises him

    ''According to KedÄrabhaá¹­á¹­a in Vá¹›ttaratnÄkara, a short vowel followed by a consonant cluster 
    (i.e., multiple consonants), although guru by default, can optionally be treated as laghu if
    that consonant cluster happens to be the beginning of a new word. Implement this option.
    (With required UI changes, e.g. saying: "this verse can be read as ... if an option is used in places x, y, z.") ''

    SOURCE: ( https://github.com/shreevatsa/sanskrit/issues/1 ):
    ``The traditional rule is that the presence of a conjunct consonant (consonant cluster) makes
      the preceding syllable a guru syllable. For purists, this is an inviolable rule, and there are no exceptions.

        However, under the influence of PrÄká¹›ta and deÅ›a-bhÄÃ¡¹£Ä prosody, and also music, 
        later prosodists give poets the option to either conform to this rule, or to occasionally indulge in an exception.
        This exception is stated differently by different authors:

        In Kannada and Telugu prosody, under the name of Å›ithila-dvitva, the exception is that sometimes in
        a consonant cluster of the form [consonant + "r"], the "r" (repha) can be ignored, so that it is not a conjunct consonant anymore.
        KedÄra-bhaá¹­á¹­a in his Vá¹›tta-ratnÄkara states the exception as: if the consonant cluster is at the
        beginning of a word, then it may be treated as a single consonant.
        Yet another way of stating the exception is that a consonant cluster can be optionally 
        treated as a single consonant if the effort of pronouncing it is quick 
        # (à¤¤à¥€à¤µà¥Ã ¤°à¤ªà¥Ã ¤°à¤¯à¤¤à¥Ã ¤¨à¥Ù€¤¨) 
        or with less effort
        # (à¤¶à¥Ã ¤°à¤®à¤®à¤¨à¥Ã ¤¤à¤°à¤¾).)
    All ways of stating the exception cover the example of
    # "à¤¨à¤¿à¤¦à¥Ã ¤°à¤µà¥Ã ¤¯à¥‹ à¤¹à¥Ã ¤°à¤¿à¤¯à¤®à¥Ù€¤¤à¤¿ à¤¹à¥Ã ¤°à¥€à¤ªà¤°à¤¿à¤çˆ¤à¤ƒ à¤ªà¥Ã ¤°à¤­à¥Ã ¤°à¤¶à¥Ã ¤¯à¤¤à¥‡ à¤¤à¥Ù€¤œà¤¸à¤ƒ", 
    but KedÄrabhaá¹­á¹­a's way doesn't cover the example of "à¤°à¤¾à¤œà¥Ã ¤à¤¾à¤‚ à¤®à¤§à¥Ã ¤¯à¥‡ à¤¸à¤ªà¤¦à¤¿ à¤œà¤¹à¥Ã ¤°à¤¿à¤·à¥‡ à¤®à¤¿à¤¤à¥Ã ¤°à¤µà¤¿à¤¨à¥Ã ¤¦à¤¾à¤®à¤µà¤¨à¥Ã ¤¤à¥€à¤®à¥" from the NÄrÄyaá¹Ø¤«yam. So far I don't see a reason to prefer KedÄrabhaá¹­á¹­a's formulation over the others.

    But anyway, to return to the main point:

       The exception is not accepted by purists: Shatavadhani Ganesh says that the Sanskrit masters like
       KÄlidÄsa, BhÄravi, MÄgha, ÅšrÄ«hará¹£a, and ViÅ›Äkhadatta have not freely used this exception (though the masters in Kannada
       and other languages have).
       Being more of a "poetic licence" and a violation of the standard rule (only found in later poetry),
       it is extremely unlikely that any sane poet would have indulged in that exception in all four pÄda-s of a verse.
       Thus it is very unlikely that the program will miss identifying a verse that indulges in this exception.
       At least, I haven't seen any example from real life so far. (Just saying that because
       it would be easy to intentionally compose a verse to disproves this!)

                  it starts on f. 193 (the recto side, online image no. 381,      
                  is an empty folio side, the text itself starts on the verso side);
                  it ends on f. 239r (and not 193r, as the online description says; online image no. 472).
                  The text of the VSS is transmitted fully, without any folios or major sections of the text missing.
          The leaves transmitting the VSS are well-preserved. Some folio
                sides are faded and most folios are somewhat damaged on the right side, 
                sometimes at other parts, and it seems from the images that some opaque-looking tape has been
                applied to protect these damaged sections. In my critical edition the broken off, completely lost,
                /aká¹£ara/s are represented by Ã—, the illegible /aká¹£ara/s under the tape by Â¤. CHECK
          The quality of the readings of this manuscript is one of the best,
          comparable only to \msNa\ and \msP, making it one of the most
          important sources for the VSS.

                This is more difficult to see in the VSS, but indeed, they

             f. 237r
             Remark: the Vá¹à¤›£asÄrasaá¹ƒgraha seems to start in a different hand, but then it changes.
             In this MTM, the VSS is trasmitted in an incomplete form, that is to say,
                  a number of folios are missing (most notably chapters 15--17).
             The text starts on a folio which is labelled 237r in the online Digital Library of 
                  the University of Cambridge (image no. 181). 
              This folio in fact has no visible foliation and is written in a hand that is clearly different 
                  from that of the previous one.
            (That folio, image no. 180, ended with verse 7.122cd of the /Åšivopaniá¹£ad/:
                  /yauvanasthÄ gá¹›hasthÄÃ…› ca/ [/prÄsÄ/]/dasthÄÃ…› ca ye ná¹›pÄÃ¡¸¥/.)
            In image 183 (folio 268r, according to the ULC website), the hand changes back to one that is similar to that
                  in image 180. 
            In image 184, the characters for folio number 200+60 are visible (268v, according to the ULC website).
            In image 186, the folio number 269 is clearly visible (f. 269v). 
            In folio 270v, the continuous text is broken at verse 2.21c (/kÄmarÅ«Â°/), 
                  folios 271 and 272 are missing, and the text resumes on folio 273r with verse 3.30b
                  (/ahiá¹ƒsÄ pa/]/ramaá¹ƒ sukham/). 
            In folio 296v (image no. 234) the text breaks off again at
                  /vÄtaÅ›Å«lair upadrutÄ/ | /Å›ukro/ (verse 14.XX CHECK), the
                  next folio being 306r (/carmatÄÃ…› ca dvijasundarÄ«á¹£u/} (verse 18.XX CHECK) 
                  (nine folios and chapters 15--17 are completely missing).
            Again, there are two missing folios after \skt{bandhus sarvvaÂ°} in
                  verse 18.XX CHECK in folio 306v. 
            The text resumes in folio 309r (image 237) with /Â°á¹‡eá¹£u ca sarvveá¹£u vidvÄn sreá¹£á¹­ha sa ucyate/
                  (verse 19.XX CHECK). 
            Another folio is missing between /iá¹£á¹­Äniá¹£á¹­advayaÂ°/ (verse 20.XX CHECK, folio 309v)
                  and /snÄyu majjÄ sirÄ tathÄ/ (verse 20.XX CHECK, folio 311r). 
            The VSS ends on folio 322v (image no. 262) with the concluding
                  colophon /vá¹à¤›£asÄrasaá¹…graha samÄpta iti/.
            This folio also contains the beginning of the /DharmaputrikÄ/, but this multiple-text manuscript contains no more folios.

            I used this manuscript extensively in the critical edition. 
            It is a MTM containing 74 folios.
            Contents: 
            1) Åšivadharmottara
            2) UmÄmaheÅ›varasaá¹ƒvÄda
            3) Åšivopaniá¹£ad  
            4) Vá¹à¤›£asÄrasaá¹ƒgraha
            Some folios feature monochrome drawings.
            A great number of the leaves that transmit the VSS
            are damaged, faded and slightly disordered. The folio numbers are rarely visible.
            The VSS starts on exp. 44 (upper leaf, no folio number is visible here).
            It continues on the lower leaf and then on the upper leaf on exp. 43
                  (going backwards) up to 1.62 (/viá¹ÄŠ›akoá¹­iá¹£u gulmeá¹£u Å«rdhvaÂ°/).
            Verses 1.62cd--2.22 seem to be missing.
            The lower leaf on exp. 43 contains verses 2.23--2.39.
            The single leaf in exp. 42 contains verses 2.40--3.16a.
            Exp. 41 contains a single leaf of the /UmÄmaheÅ›varasaá¹ƒvÄda/,
                  ending in a colophon for its chapter twenty-two,
                  and still going backwards, the preceding folios continue transmitting the /UmÄmaheÅ›varasaá¹ƒvÄda/.
            Exploring the presence of the VSS in
                  this manuscript further, one should look at the expositions after no. 44.
            Exp. 45 contains the end of the /Åšivopaniá¹£ad/.
            The single leaf on exp. 46 is almost illegible but most probably contains
                  a fragment of the /GautamadharmasÅ«tra/. 
            The second line just above the string hole on the left reads 
                  /... vÄ«rud vanaspatÄ«nÄÃ¡¹ƒ ca puá¹£pÄÃ¡¹‡i svavad ÄdadÄ«te.../,
                  which is a fragment of /GautamadharmasÅ«tra/ 2.3.25 (12.28).
            The remaining parts of the VSS are to be found on exp. 47ff. 
            The upper leaf on exp. 47 continues with VSS 3.16b-36ab,
                  while the lower leaf contains a text that I have not been able to identify.
            The lower leaf in exp. 48 transmits 3.36cd--4.11ab, the upper one 4.11b--30a.
            The lower leaf in exp. 49 contains 4.30ab--47ab, the upper one 47d--68a.
            And so on so forth.
            Thus when reading the text from these images, after exp. 48,
                  one has to start with the lower leaf and continue with the upper one.

** Editorial policies
    - avagrahas usually supplied but sometimes found in the MSS
    - usually 4 pÄdas to a verse, but I have made arbitrary decisions based on sense-units 
      because none of the sources really indicate where a verse ends (||).
    - falsifications everywhere on purpose and accidentallyq
