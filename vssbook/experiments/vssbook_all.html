<h3 id="on-the-title">On the title</h3>
<p>The main question concerning the title Vṛṣasārasaṃgraha (‘A Compendium on the Essence of the Bull [of Dharma]’) is weather the bull in the title is only a reference to a representation of Dharma or also a hint at Śiva’s vehicle, sometimes named Nandi.</p>
<p>Dharma has frequently been referred to as a bull in Sanskrit literature from at least the time of the MBh, e.g. in this passage:</p>
<pre><code>    MBh on the 4-legged bull:
    03188010a kṛte catuṣpāt sakalo nirvyājopādhivarjitaḥ
    03188010c vṛṣaḥ pratiṣṭhito dharmo manuṣyeṣv abhavat purā
    03188011a adharmapādaviddhas tu tribhir aṃśaiḥ pratiṣṭhitaḥ
    03188011c tretāyāṃ dvāpare &#39;rdhena vyāmiśro dharma ucyate
    03188012a tribhir aṃśair adharmas tu lokān ākramya tiṣṭhati
    03188012c caturthāṃśena dharmas tu manuṣyān upatiṣṭhati
    03188013a āyur vīryam atho buddhir balaṃ tejaś ca pāṇḍava
    03188013c manuṣyāṇām anuyugaṃ hrasatīti nibodha me</code></pre>
<p>Manusmṛti also confirms this (8.16a): vṛṣo hi bhagavān dharma.</p>
<p>MMW ‘vṛṣa’:<br />
“Justice or Virtue personified as a bull or as”Siva’s bull Mn. viii, 16 Pur. Kāvyād.; just or virtuous act, virtue, moral merit “Siś. Vās.;”</p>
<p>Mahākṣapaṇaka’s koṣa (CHECK date), the Anekārthadhvanimañjarī, places the meaning ‘dharma’ as first when defining the word ‘vṛṣa’:</p>
<pre><code>    dharmo vṛṣo vṛṣaḥ śreṣṭho vṛṣo gaurmūṣiko vṛṣaḥ |
    vṛṣo balaṃ vṛṣaḥ kāmo vṛṣalo vṛṣa ucyate || 1.48
    </code></pre>
<p>The ŚDhU also mentions the ‘Dharma bull’:</p>
<pre><code>    īśvarāyatanasyādhaḥ śrīmān dharmavṛṣaḥ sthitaḥ ||
    yatra vīravṛṣas tatra kṣityāṃ gomātaraḥ sthitā || 12.87</code></pre>
<p>visnusmrḍn:ViS 86.15a/ vṛṣo hi bhagavān dharmaś catuṣ-pādaḥ prakīrtitaḥ /</p>
<p>smrti/dharma/krtyaratnaakara.dn: !!! dharmo ’yaṃ vṛṣarūpeṇa nāmnā nandīśavaro vibhuḥ | dharmān māheśvarān vakṣyaty ataḥ prabhṛti nārada||</p>
<p>tak2015/AtmapujaT55Muktabodha.dn: dharmas tatra vṛṣākāro jñānaḥ siṃhasvarūpakaḥ | vairāgyaṃ</p>
<p>On the title, see De Simini 2016:238 n. 13: ‘’As noted by Sanderson […], this title can have a double meaning, since the ‘bull’ (vṛṣa) is both a synonym of ‘religious practice’ and the traditional mount (vāhana) of Śiva. i.e. Sanderson (Forthc. b), Śaivism and Brahmanism. (can’t find it)</p>
<p>Sanderson Tolerance p. 210 n. 136: “[…] To laud the bull (<em>vṛṣa</em>) [on the coins of the Hephthalite Hun Mihirakula, CsK] would be surprising if the intended meaning were the bull that is Śiva’s mount, but not if the word is intended in its figurative meaning, namely <em>dharmaḥ</em>, or <em>sukṛtam</em> ‘the virtuous actions [prescribed by the Veda].’ For this meaning of <em>vṛṣaḥ</em> see, for example, Amarasiṃha, <em>Nāmaliṅgānuśāsana</em> 1.4.25b (<em>sukṛtam vṛṣaḥ</em>), 3.3.220 (<em>sukṛte vṛṣabhe vṛṣaḥ</em>); Halāyudha, <em>Abhidhānaratnamālā</em> 1.125cd (<em>dharmaḥ puṇyaṃ vṛṣaḥ śreyaḥ sukṛtaṃ ca samaṃ smṛtam</em>); <em>Manusmṛti</em> 8[. CsK]16a CHECK (<em>vṛṣo hi bhagavān dharmas …</em>); and the Gwalior Museum Stone Inscription of Pataṅgaśambhu ( 1962), l. 15, <em>vṛṣaikaniṣṭho ‘pi jitasmaro ’pi yaḥ śaṅkaro ’bhūd bhuvi ko ’py apūrvvaḥ,* concerning the Śaiva ascetic Vyomaśambhu: ’He was in the world an extraordinary new Śiva, since he too was <em>vṛṣaikaniṣṭhaḥ</em> (’devoted solely to pious observance’; in Śiva’s case ‘riding only on the Bull’) and he too was </em>jitasmaraḥ* (‘one who had defeated sensual urges’; in Śiva’s case ‘the defeater of the Love god Kāmadeva’). This is also the meaning of <em>vṛṣaḥ</em> in the title <em>Vṛṣasārasaṃgraha</em>, one of the works of the Śivadharma corpus (see, e.g.,  2014, p. 2), i.e., ‘Summary of the Essentials of the [Śiva]dharma’.”</p>

<li>niśvāsa as sadāśiva in ch. 16; Niśvāsa uttarasūtra 5.50-51; see also Kafle Niśvāsamukha p.11ff; ibid. p.12: “The term niśvāsa means sighing. Thus, an alternative meaning of the Niśvāsatattvasaṃhitā could also be a ‘‘sighing tantra.’’ To be more precise, a tantra that originated from the sighing of Śiva. This is to say, the speech of Śiva.”</li>

<h1 id="notes-on-the-language">Notes on the language</h1>
<p>The language of the VSS goes beyond the idiosyncrasies of epic Sanskrit. It exhibits strong similarities to Śaiva Aiśa Sanskrit,<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> and it applies particular metrical licences and uses a special vocabulary, morphology and syntax. The analysis of this language may lead us to the author(s) and to the place of composition. Here I only give a brief overview of the most important phenomena. For details see the Notes on the constitution of the Sanskrit text and the Index.</p>
<h2 id="metre">Metre</h2>
<p>As regards metrical licences, the first striking feature is the generous use of the poetic licence sometimes labelled ‘muta cum liquida,’<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> namely that some consonant clusters that would normally turn the previous short (laghu) syllable long (guru) may in some cases do not do so. The syllables pra, bra, hra, kra, especially at the beginning of words CHECK, are well-known candidates for this licence.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> In the VSS, tra, vra, śra, pra, and also śya, śva, sva, dva, all involving conjunct consonants with a liquid sounds or semi-vowels in second position, and possibly also rpa,CHECK! seem additional ones.</p>
<p>The well-known author on prosody, Kedārabhaṭṭa, who must definitely be much later than the time of composition of the VSS since he is frequently quoted by Mallinātha, gives the following definition in his Vṛttaratnākara (here given together with Sulhana’s Sukavihṛdayanandinī commentary):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>padādāv iha varṇasya saṃyogaḥ kramasaṃjñikaḥ</em> |<br />
<em>puraḥsthitena tena syāl laghutā ’pi kvacid guroḥ</em> || 1.10 ||</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>vibhaktyantaṃ padaṃ tasya padasyādau vartamāno yo varṇas tasya saṃyogaḥ</em> | <em>sa iha śāstre kramasaṃjño jñeyaḥ</em> | <em>tena krameṇa purovartinā prākpadānte vartamānasya prāptagurubhāvasyāpi laghutā syāt</em> | <em>kvacil lakṣānurodhena</em> | <em>nanu ka eṣaḥ kramo nāma saṃyoga ucyate</em> | <em>pūrvācāryāṇāṃ piṅgalanāgaprabhṛtīnāṃ kālidāsādīnāṃ ca kavīnāṃ samayaḥ parigṛhītaḥ</em> | <em>saṃyogaḥ kramasaṃyogaḥ</em> || 10 ||<br> <em>tatra gra-saṃyogena yathā</em> | <em>idam asyodāharaṇam</em> |</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>taruṇaṃ sarṣapaśākaṃ navaudanaṃ picchalāni ca dadhīni</em> |<br />
<em>alpavyayena sundari grāmyajano miṣṭam aśnāti</em> || 1.11 ||</p>
</blockquote>
<p>TRANSLATE the whole passage!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In this [work], a consonant cluster at the beginning of a word is called krama. A [preceding] long syllable can sometimes be turned short by that initial [syllable].</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>   ... TRANSLATE </code></pre>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Tender mustard seed, fresh porridge, and slimy curds: village people eat this kind of dishes, O beautiful goddess, due to lack of money.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To sum this example up: the verse given above (1.11) is in āryā, and the metric pattern of the second half-verse is the following: - - . - . - . - - . . - - . - - - This yields 28 morae, instead of the expected 27. By treating the final syllable of sundari short, in spite of the following grā, the pattern conforms to the expected pattern: - - . - . - . . - . . - - . - - -</p>
<p>The commentator gives several more examples (involving the syllables gra, hra, bhra), including this Śārdūla line:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>nidravyo hriyam eti hrīparigataḥ prabhraśyate tejasaḥ</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this line, the last syllable of eti should count as short, in spite of the fact that the beginning of the next word (hrī°) would normally turn it long.</p>
<p>The VSS abounds in this phenomenon of ‘muta cum liquida’. EXAMPLES from the VSS and from my emendations. CHECK</p>
<ul>
<li>only beginning of words in the VSS?</li>
<li><p>final -am etc. counts as long (reverse of muta cum liquida)</p></li>
<li><p>In Kannada and Telugu prosody, under the name of śithila-dvitva, the exception is that sometimes in a consonant cluster of the form [consonant + “r”], the “r” (repha) can be ignored, so that it is not a conjunct consonant anymore.</p></li>
<li><p>The exception is not accepted by purists: Shatavadhani Ganesh says that the Sanskrit masters like Kālidāsa, Bhāravi, Māgha, Śrīharṣa, and Viśākhadatta have not freely used this exception (though the masters in Kannada and other languages have). Being more of a “poetic licence” and a violation of the standard rule (only found in later poetry), it is extremely unlikely that any sane poet would have indulged in that exception in all four pāda-s of a verse. Thus it is very unlikely that the program will miss identifying a verse that indulges in this</p></li>

<p>In the manuscript descriptions below, in addition to some general remarks, I will mainly focus on information relevant to the VSS. For much more detail on the overall features of these manuscripts, see De Simini 2016 [CHECK SDh MSS from Nepal] and the catalogues I mention at each individual manuscript.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>In recently published and forthcoming critical editions of and articles on the Śivadharma corpus (CHECK examples), the sigla of the manuscripts used are made up of a letter signifying the script (e.g. ‘N’ for Nepālākṣara/Newari), a superscript letter for the current location where the manuscript is deposited (e.g. ‘C’ for Cambridge), and two (sometimes only one or even three) subscript digits echoing the last digit(s) of the reference number of the manuscript in the library where it is located or, in the case of NGMPP reel numbers, the last two digits of the first part of the reel number. For details of this system and for the underlying reasons, see Bisschop 2018b, 50–51 (UnivŚ). Since in the case of the Vṛṣasārasaṃgraha all available manuscripts use some variants of the Nepālākṣara script, in this publication I have left the first letter out, making the letter for the current location non-superscript. This makes the apparatus more readable. In the manuscript descriptions below, I give this implied ‘N’ in brackets as a reminder.</p>

See a detailed description of this manuscript at the CUL online catalogue.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> According to this catalogue, the date of creation is the 12th century, the dimensions of the manuscript are 5cm × ca. 53.5cm. The script is Nepālākṣara. It is a palm-leaf multiple-text manuscript containing 258 folios. Eight texts are transmitted in this manuscript: 1) Śivadharmaśāstra 2) Śivadharmottara 3) Śivadharmasaṃgraha 4) Umāmaheśvarasaṃvāda 5) Uttarottaramahāsaṃvāda 6) Vṛṣasārasaṃgraha 7) Dharmaputrikā 8) Śivopaniṣad.</p>
<p>The VSS occupies 45 folios: it starts on f. 193 (the recto side, online image no. 381, is an empty folio side, the text itself starts on the verso side); it ends on f. 239r (and not 193r, as the online description says; online image no. 472). The text of the VSS is transmitted fully, without any folios or major sections of the text missing. The leaves transmitting the VSS are well-preserved. Some folio sides are faded and most folios are somewhat damaged on the right side, sometimes at other parts, and it seems from the images that some opaque-looking tape has been applied to protect these damaged sections. In my critical edition the broken off, completely lost, <em>akṣara</em>s are represented by ×, the illegible <em>akṣara</em>s under the tape by ¤ (‘illegible’). The quality of the readings of this manuscript is one of the best, comparable only to msNa and msP, making it one of the most important sources for the VSS. <!-- ayutaif msCa 1.53d --></p>

<p>Cambridge University Library, Add. 2102. Palm-leaf, 96 folios. Fully collated all available folios for chapters 1–12 of the critical edition in this volume. See a detailed description of this manuscript at the CUL online catalogue.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> According to this catalogue site, the date of creation is the 12th century, the dimensions of the manuscript are 4.8cm × ca. 52.5cm. The script is Nepālākṣara. It is a palm-leaf multiple-text manuscript containing 96 folios. Six texts are transmitted in this manuscript: 1) Śivadharmottara 2) Śivadharmasaṃgraha 3) Umāmaheśvarasaṃvāda 4) Śivopaniṣad 5) Vṛṣasārasaṃgraha 6) Dharmaputrikā (only fol. 322v).</p>
<p>The Vṛṣasārasaṃgraha starts on f. 267r line 1<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> (online image 181) in a hand which is different from the rest of the manuscript, but it changes back in the next folio.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>In this multiple-text manuscript, the VSS is trasmitted in an incomplete form, that is to say, a number of folios are missing (most notably chapters 15–17). The first partially visible folio number is in image 184: the numeral characters 200+60 are visible (268v, according to the CUL online catalogue). In image 186, the folio number 269 is clearly visible (f. 269v). In folio 270v, the continuous text is broken at verse 2.21c (<em>kāmarū°</em>), folios 271 and 272 are missing, and the text resumes on folio 273r with verse 3.30b ([<em>ahiṃsā pa</em>]<em>ramaṃ</em> <em>sukham</em>). Folio 291 is missing (verses 12.87cd–12.113). In folio 296v (image no. 234) the text breaks off again at <em>vātaśūlair upadrutā</em> | <em>śukro</em> (verse 14.XX CHECK), the next folio being 306r (<em>carmatāś ca dvijasundarīṣu</em>) (verse 18.XX CHECK) (nine folios and chapters 15–17 are completely missing).</p>
<p>Again, there are two missing folios after <em>bandhus sarvva°</em> in verse 18.XX CHECK in f. 306v. The text resumes in folio 309r (image 237) with <em>°ṇeṣu ca sarvveṣu vidvān sreṣṭha sa ucyate</em> (verse 19.XX CHECK). Another folio is missing between <em>iṣṭāniṣṭadvaya°</em> (verse 20.XX CHECK, folio 309v) and <em>snāyu majjā sirā tathā</em> (verse 20.XX CHECK, folio 311r). The VSS ends on folio 322v (image no. 262) with the concluding colophon <em>vṛṣasārasaṅgraha samāpta iti</em>. This folio also contains the beginning of the <em>Dharmaputrikā</em>, but this multiple-text manuscript contains no more folios.</p>

<p>NGMPP A 10/5, NAK 1/1261. Fully collated for chapters 1–12 of the critical edition in this volume. See a brief description of this MS in the NGMCP online catalogue.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> According to this catalogue, the dimensions of the manuscript are 55 x 5.5cm. Undated. It is a palm-leaf multiple-text manuscript containing 74 folios. Four text are transmitted in this manuscript: 1) Śivadharmottara 2) Umāmaheśvarasaṃvāda 3) Śivopaniṣad 4) Vṛṣasārasaṃgraha.</p>
<p>Some folios feature monochrome drawings. A great number of the leaves that transmit the VSS are damaged and, at least judging from the microfilm images, faded and slightly disordered. The folio numbers are rarely visible. The VSS starts on exp. 44 (upper leaf, no folio number is visible here). It continues on the lower leaf and then on the upper leaf on exp. 43 (going backwards) up to 1.62 (<em>viṃśakoṭiṣu gulmeṣu ūrdhva°</em>). Verses 1.62cd–2.22 seem to be missing. The lower leaf on exp. 43 contains verses 2.23–2.39. The single leaf in exp. 42 contains verses 2.40–3.16a. Exp. 41 contains a single leaf of the <em>Umāmaheśvarasaṃvāda</em>, ending in a colophon for its chapter twenty-two, and still going backwards, the preceding folios continue transmitting the <em>Umāmaheśvarasaṃvāda</em>. Exploring the presence of the VSS in this manuscript further, one should look at the expositions after no. 44. Exp. 45 contains the end of the <em>Śivopaniṣad</em>. The single leaf on exp. 46 is almost illegible but most probably contains a fragment of the <em>Gautamadharmasūtra</em>. The second line just above the string hole on the left reads <em>… vīrud vanaspatīnāṃ ca puṣpāṇi svavad</em> <em>ādadīte…</em>, which is a fragment of <em>Gautamadharmasūtra</em> 2.3.25 (12.28). The remaining parts of the VSS are to be found on exp. 47ff. The upper leaf on exp. 47 continues with VSS 3.16b-36ab, while the lower leaf contains a text that I have not been able to identify. The lower leaf in exp. 48 transmits 3.36cd–4.11ab, the upper one 4.11b–30a. The lower leaf in exp. 49 contains 4.30ab–47ab, the upper one 47d–68a. And so on so forth. Thus when reading the text from these images, after exp. 48, one has to start with the lower leaf and continue with the upper one.</p>

Skt. 57-B. 23. It contains 249 palm leaves, each folio containing six lines. The following palm leaves are missing: 3, 8, 47, 48, 135, 197, 214 et 216. Foliation is in the verso: on middle of the lef-hand margin in combination of Newari letters and in the middle of right-hand in roman numbers by a second hand. There are two binding holes: one in the centre lef and one in the centre right. The manuscript is some times damaged in margins with considerable loos of the text. The text is written in a clear hand and contains few mistakes. Although it is undated manuscript, it could be dated to the 11th century AD on the palaeographical grounds.3 It contains the following text in the order they are presented in the manuscript: Śivadharmaśāstra (fols. 1–40), Śivadharmottaraśāstra (fols. 40–93), Śivadharmasaṃgraha (fols. 94–142), Umāmaheśvarasaṃvāda (fols. 143–172), Śivopaniṣad (fols. 173– 189), Uttarottaramahāsaṃvāda (fols. 190–211), Vṛṣasārasaṃgraha (fols. 212–252), Dharmaputrikā (fols. 253–262). This source contains reliable readings and contains few scribble mistakes.Śivāśramādhyāya covers fols. 33v4–37r3. Nirajan says it reads close to Naraharinātha’s edition</p>

The element <em>dvādaśipyaḍi</em> might be read as <em>dvādaśiyā</em> <em>di</em>, perhaps a mistake for <em>dvādaśyāṃ</em> <em>di</em> (<em>di</em> for a misplaced <em>diva/divā</em>?), and the symbol that does look like a figure ‘8’ of a slightly later period than the manuscript itself (resembling the mathematical symbol &lt;) might also be a <em>kākapada</em>. Another faint <em>kākapada</em> is perhaps to be seen under <em>daśi</em>, therefore it is possible that the scribe’s intention was to delete <em>dvādaśi</em>° and correct it to <em>trayodaśyām</em>, and then the date becomes the 11th of July. Kengo Harimoto has suggested that the unclear element (<em>yādi/pyaḍi</em>) is in fact <em>ghaṭi</em>, and after comparing these two syllables to other instances of <em>gha</em> and <em>ṭa</em>, one could not be agree. In this case this should be an indication of the exact time the scribe finished copying the text. It is still not clear if we should take <em>dvādaśi</em> or <em>trayodaśyām</em> as the date. For help on the conversion of the date and for a detailed discussion on the colophon I am indebted to Kengo Harimoto.<a href="#fnref7" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>

<li id="fn11"><p>Cf. the metadata on the CUL site: ‘1 folio of the same dimensions is a modern supply for the beginning of the <em>Vṛṣasārasaṃgraha</em>.’ A hardly readable note in pencil to the same effect is visible at the top of the first folio side (f. 267r, ‘mode…… supply beg of Vṛṣasāra-saṃgr.’). I am not sure how ‘modern’ this supplement is, but it seems indeed likely that a lost first folio was supplemented with a later copy. To match the end of this new copy with the beginning of the next, older, folio, a scribe more or less erased the beginning of the first line in the old folio, rather than the other way round. This slightly illogical decision may mean that the younger copy was not tailor-made for the old portion, but rather that it was taken from a younger manuscript which was perhaps considered more legible. Otherwise it would have been more practical to stop copying the first folio at the point where the next begins. (The folio coming before this supplement, image no. 180, ends with verse 7.122cd of the <em>Śivopaniṣad</em>: <em>yauvanasthā gṛhasthāś ca</em> [<em>prāsā</em>]<em>dasthāś ca ye nṛpāḥ</em>.)<a href="#fnref11" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
