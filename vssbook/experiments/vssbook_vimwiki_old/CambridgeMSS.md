Cambridge University Library, Add. 1694.1. Fully
collated for chapters 1--12 of the critical
edition in this volume.  See a detailed description of this
manuscript at the CUL online catalogue.[^NC94Catlink]
According to this catalogue, the date of creation
is the 12th century, the dimensions of the
manuscript are 5cm × ca. 53.5cm.  The script is
Nepālākṣara.  It is a palm-leaf multiple-text manuscript
containing 258 folios.  Eight texts are transmitted in this
manuscript: 1) Śivadharmaśāstra 2) Śivadharmottara
3) Śivadharmasaṃgraha 4) Umāmaheśvarasaṃvāda 5)
Uttarottaramahāsaṃvāda 6) Vṛṣasārasaṃgraha 7)
Dharmaputrikā 8) Śivopaniṣad.

The VSS occupies 45 folios: it starts on f. 193 (the
recto side, online image no. 381, is an empty folio
side, the text itself starts on the verso side); it
ends on f. 239r (and not 193r, as the online
description says; online image no. 472).  The text of
the VSS is transmitted fully, without any folios or
major sections of the text missing.  The leaves
transmitting the VSS are well-preserved. Some folio
sides are faded and most folios are somewhat damaged on
the right side, sometimes at other parts, and it seems
from the images that some opaque-looking tape has been
applied to protect these damaged sections. In my
critical edition the broken off, completely lost,
*akṣara*s are represented by ×, the illegible *akṣara*s
under the tape by ¤ ('illegible'). The quality of the readings
of this manuscript is one of the best, comparable only
to msNa and msP, making it one of the most important
sources for the VSS.  <!-- ayutaif msCa 1.53d -->

Cambridge University Library, Add. 1645.  Fully
collated for chapters 1--12 of the critical
edition in this volume.  See a detailed description of this
manuscript at the CUL online catalogue.[^NC45Catlink]
According to this catalogue, the dimensions of the
manuscript are 4.4cm × 61.7cm.  The manuscript
is dated to (Nepali) '*samvat* 259 *śrāvaṇa
śukla dvādaśiyādi*(?) < *trayodaśyām*,' which
converts to July 10/11 Monday/Tuesday, 1139 CE.[^NC45disc] The
script is Nepālākṣara.  It is a palm-leaf multiple-text
manuscript containing 247 folios.  Eight texts are
transmitted in this manuscript: 1) Śivadharmaśāstra 2)
Śivadharmottara 3) Śivadharmasaṃgraha 4) Śivopaniṣad
5) Umāmaheśvarasaṃvāda 6) Uttarottaramahāsaṃvāda
7) Vṛṣasārasaṃgraha 8) Dharmaputrikā.

   F. 247r line 6. The Cambridge site transcribes this
   colophon as: *saṃvat* 259 *śrāvaṇaśukladvādaśi[pyaḍi* 8
   *trayodaśyāṃ* (retrived 8 Dec 2021).  The element
   *dvādaśipyaḍi* might be read as *dvādaśiyā*  *di*,
   perhaps a mistake for *dvādaśyāṃ* *di* (*di* for a
   misplaced *diva/divā*?), and the symbol that does look
   like a figure '8' of a slightly later period than the
   manuscript itself (resembling the mathematical symbol <)
   might also be a *kākapada*. Another faint *kākapada* is
   perhaps to be seen under *daśi*, therefore it is possible
   that the scribe's intention was to delete *dvādaśi*° and
   correct it to *trayodaśyām*, and then the date becomes
   the 11th of July.  Kengo Harimoto has suggested that the
   unclear element (*yādi/pyaḍi*) is in fact *ghaṭi*, and
   after comparing these two syllables to other instances of
   *gha* and *ṭa*, one could not be agree.  In this case
   this should be an indication of the exact time the scribe
   finished copying the text. It is still not clear if we
   should take *dvādaśi* or *trayodaśyām* as the date. 
   For help on the conversion of the date and for a detailed
   discussion on the colophon I am indebted to Kengo
   Harimoto. 
  
The VSS occupies 37 folios plus one folio side: it starts on
f. 201v line 4 (online image no. 404), it ends on f. 238v
line 3 (online image no. 478).  The readings of this
manuscript seem to follow those of msNa remarkably closely
transmitting the Śivadharmottara (as observed by De Simini and
Harimoto.^[
                Personal communication, 1 Dec 2021.] 
This is more difficult to see in the VSS, but indeed, they 
seem closely related. CHECK MORE on this

Cambridge University Library, Add. 2102. Palm-leaf,
96 folios.  Fully collated all available folios for
chapters 1--12 of the critical edition in this volume.
See a detailed description of this manuscript at the
CUL online catalogue.[^NC02*CUL*link] According to this
catalogue site, the date of creation is the 12th century,
the dimensions of the manuscript are 4.8cm × ca. 52.5cm.
The script is Nepālākṣara.  It is a palm-leaf
multiple-text manuscript containing 96 folios.  Six texts
are transmitted in this manuscript: 1) Śivadharmottara
2) Śivadharmasaṃgraha 3) Umāmaheśvarasaṃvāda 4)
Śivopaniṣad 5) Vṛṣasārasaṃgraha 6) Dharmaputrikā
(only fol. 322v).

The Vṛṣasārasaṃgraha starts on f. 267r line 1[^noton237]
(online image 181) in a hand which is different from the
rest of the manuscript, but it changes back in the next
folio.[^NC02*hand]  

   [^noton237]:
   Not on f. 237r as the online description claims.
   This first folio in fact has no visible foliation.
 
   [^NC02*hand]: 
   Cf. the metadata on the CUL site: '1 folio of the same
   dimensions is a modern supply for the beginning of the
   *Vṛṣasārasaṃgraha*.' A hardly readable note in pencil to
   the same effect is visible at the top of the first folio
   side (f. 267r, 'mode......  supply beg of
   Vṛṣasāra-saṃgr.').  I am not sure how 'modern' this
   supplement is, but it seems indeed likely that a lost
   first folio was supplemented with a later copy. To match
   the end of this new copy with the beginning of the next,
   older, folio, a scribe more or less erased the beginning
   of the first line in the old folio, rather than the other
   way round. This slightly illogical decision may mean that
   the younger copy was not tailor-made for the old portion,
   but rather that it was taken from a younger manuscript
   which was perhaps considered more legible.  Otherwise it
   would have been more practical to stop copying the first
   folio at the point where the next begins.  (The folio
   coming before this supplement, image no. 180, ends with
   verse 7.122cd of the *Śivopaniṣad*: *yauvanasthā
   gṛhasthāś ca* [*prāsā*]*dasthāś ca ye nṛpāḥ*.) 


In this multiple-text manuscript, the VSS is trasmitted
in an incomplete form, that is to say, a number of folios
are missing (most notably chapters 15--17). The first
partially visible folio number is in image 184: the
numeral characters 200+60 are visible (268v, according
to the CUL online catalogue).  In image 186, the folio
number 269 is clearly visible (f.  269v).  In folio
270v, the continuous text is broken at verse 2.21c
(*kāmarū°*), folios 271 and 272 are missing, and the
text resumes on folio 273r with verse 3.30b ([*ahiṃsā
pa*]*ramaṃ* *sukham*). Folio 291 is missing (verses
12.87cd--12.113). In folio 296v (image no. 234)
the text breaks off again at *vātaśūlair upadrutā* |
*śukro* (verse 14.XX CHECK), the next folio being 306r
(*carmatāś ca dvijasundarīṣu*) (verse 18.XX CHECK)
(nine folios and chapters 15--17 are completely missing).

Again, there are two missing folios after *bandhus sarvva°*
in verse 18.XX CHECK in f. 306v.  The text resumes in folio
309r (image 237) with *°ṇeṣu ca sarvveṣu vidvān sreṣṭha sa
ucyate* (verse 19.XX CHECK).  Another folio is missing
between *iṣṭāniṣṭadvaya°* (verse 20.XX CHECK, folio 309v)
and *snāyu majjā sirā tathā* (verse 20.XX CHECK, folio
311r).  The VSS ends on folio 322v (image no. 262) with the
concluding colophon *vṛṣasārasaṅgraha samāpta iti*.  This
folio also contains the beginning of the *Dharmaputrikā*,
but this multiple-text manuscript contains no more folios.
