<li>general ideas

<li>is this text really Śaiva? why in this collection?</li>
<li>niśvāsa as sadāśiva in ch. 16; Niśvāsa uttarasūtra 5.50-51; see also Kafle Niśvāsamukha p.11ff; ibid. p.12: “The term niśvāsa means sighing. Thus, an alternative meaning of the Niśvāsatattvasaṃhitā could also be a ‘‘sighing tantra.’’ To be more precise, a tantra that originated from the sighing of Śiva. This is to say, the speech of Śiva.”</li>
<li>tattva-system: mati and suśira (ch. 20)</li>
<li>parallels: MBh, Bṛhatkālottara,</li>
<li>ch. 21: Viṣṇu; is this a Śaiva text?</li>
<li>āśramas are in an order different from usual; compare this to NĀT; “Variations on the āśrama-system”</li>

<li>988! see Āpastamba-dharma-sūtra ii.9.21.1: catvāra āśramā gārhasthyam ācāryakulaṃ maunaṃ vānaprasthyam iti| Quoted by Śankara But the chapters in Āpastamba follow the traditional order. “Āp. places the householder first among the āśramas, probably on account of the importance of that stage to all other āśramas.” Kane ibid.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>ibid p. 417: person in last āśrama is called: parivrāṭ, parivrājaka(!), bhikṣu, muni, yati. See Olivelle, Patrick. The Āśrama System. The History and Hermeneutics of a Religious Institution. New York, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1993. [megvan] p.82ff: The Order of Āśramas; ibid: “In later texts the usual order is student, householder, hermit, and renouncer, reflecting the sequence of the passage from one <em>āśrama</em> to another… In the Dharmasūtras, however, only Baudhāyana and Vasiṣṭha follow that order… A specific order becomes insignificant when the <em>āśramas</em> are taken as four alternative adult vocations.” Are they alternative adult vocations here in the Vṛṣasārasaṃgraha? They are numbered.</p></li>

<li><p>Bisschop 2018:2: ``The full text of the corpus was first published by Naraharinātha in 1998, while over the past few years several scholars have started to work on individual parts of the corpus or referred to them in their studies. See, in particular, Acharya 2009; Bisschop 2010, 2014; De Simini 2013, 2016a, 2016b, 2017; De Simini &amp; Mirnig 2017; Goodall 2011; Kafle 2013, 2015; Magnone 2005; Sanderson 2003/04, 2012/13; Schwartz 2012. An edition of the Śivadharmaśāstra alone, based on a single manuscript in the Adyar Library, has been published more recently as well (Jugnu &amp; Sharma 2014). The Śivopaniṣad, which also forms part of the Śivadharma corpus, was already published much earlier but was not recognised as such, being included in a collection of Upaniṣads (Kunhan Raja 1933).’’</p></li>

<p>Vipula in the MBh:</p>
<p>MBh 13040016aff</p>
<p>Devaśarman and his wife Ruci 13040017a tasya rūpeṇa –&gt; 13040017a tasyā rūpeṇa</p>
<pre><code>  all gods, esp. Indra, are in love with her but Devaśarman guards her
  wants to perform yajña: how to guard her during the ritual?  calls his
  pupil, Vipula tells him that Indra can assume various forms Vipula
  decides that the only way to protect her from Indra is to magically
  &#39;enter&#39; her (with yoga) he tells her stories and enters her 

  MBh 13041001ff Indra sees the opportunity and enters the āśrama as a
  beautiful man he sees Vipula&#39;s lifeless body Ruci fancies Indra, but
  Vipula in his body stops her from standing up Indra sings to her
  beautiful songs he says &quot;I have come for you, I am Devendra, I am in
  love&quot; Vipula stops her from doing anything Indra is a bit shocked by
  her not being moved, gets angry and can see now that Vipula is in her
  Vipula leaves her, enters his own body, and abuses Indra and tells
  Indra how wicked he is Indra is ashamed and disappears Devaśarman
  returns to the āśrama, Vipula tells him what happened and Devaśarman
  praises him</code></pre></li>
