<p>In the manuscript descriptions below, in addition to some general remarks, I will mainly focus on information relevant to the VSS. For much more detail on the overall features of these manuscripts, see De Simini 2016 [CHECK SDh MSS from Nepal] and the catalogues I mention at each individual manuscript.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>In recently published and forthcoming critical editions of and articles on the Śivadharma corpus (CHECK examples), the sigla of the manuscripts used are made up of a letter signifying the script (e.g. ‘N’ for Nepālākṣara/Newari), a superscript letter for the current location where the manuscript is deposited (e.g. ‘C’ for Cambridge), and two (sometimes only one or even three) subscript digits echoing the last digit(s) of the reference number of the manuscript in the library where it is located or, in the case of NGMPP reel numbers, the last two digits of the first part of the reel number. For details of this system and for the underlying reasons, see Bisschop 2018b, 50–51 (UnivŚ). Since in the case of the Vṛṣasārasaṃgraha all available manuscripts use some variants of the Nepālākṣara script, in this publication I have left the first letter out, making the letter for the current location non-superscript. This makes the apparatus more readable. In the manuscript descriptions below, I give this implied ‘N’ in brackets as a reminder.</p>
