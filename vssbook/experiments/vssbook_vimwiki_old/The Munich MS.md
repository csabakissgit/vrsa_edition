Kengo got it in Munich on 16 Nov 2021. VSS starts in
411.jpg 'cover' [411.jpg]: ||w|| vṛṣasārasaṃgraha
50 patra ||w|| Text starts in 412.jpeg, f.1r Ends on image
455.jpeg Has interesting readings, but mostly very corrupt
and useless.  Hand different from that of some of the other
texts in this bundle.  Collated chapter 1, will probably
not go on. Gives number of verses in colophons
