        Just an afterthought (not sure how much you use git and
        github): all this stuff about manuscript transmission,
        variants, stemmata, contamination etc... I've just realized
        (maybe it's evident) that all this is extremely similar to
        git[hub] version control... ðŸ˜Š : branches, head, master,
        forks, push, pull, commit, merge... all these are synonyms
        of what we kind of see in Indian manuscript transmission.
        The only problem is that they did not have git in medieval
        times... So Indian literary history is basically messy,
        chaotic free-software development without version control
        and with a lot of forks and branches, pulls and pushes. ðŸ˜Š

        Ha, absolutely true! The thing I was trying to explain today
        was very much like trying to incorporate a diff output into
        another versionâ€¦ by hand. One person (or more?) miserably
        failiingâ€¦

        Csaba Kiss, [2021. 12. 06. 19:29]
        Hahaha! Exactly! I wish we could just use diff and some
        automatic merge tool... Or simply 'checkout' at an early git
        branch. This parallel also reintroduces the question: do we
        want to go back to the first full commit of the author(s) or
        we should prefer a more developed version, potentially with
        more bugs...?

        Kengo Harimoto, [2021. 12. 06. 19:31]
        Very good question! What I usually think of my goal is to
        get "all" the version historiesâ€¦ Basically what kind of mess
        has actually happenedâ€¦

        Csaba Kiss, [2021. 12. 06. 20:10]
        Yes, that would be ideal. To know the whole story. But which
        version do you publish? ðŸ˜Š
