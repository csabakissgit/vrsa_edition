11.1 O Paraśreṣṭha , o Surottama! Is there another [form of] universal sacrifice? 
     REVISE Teach me, o Suraśreṣṭha, how to aquire the fruits of the universal sacrifice [in a way which is] that is unproblematic, o Sureśvara, and which is easy [to perform, but which] yields wealth/is meaningful, and is praised even by the gods. People would benefit from it. 
12.1 The Goddess spoke: 
     Harmlessness is always praised as the highest Dharma. 
     Tell me the ultimate Dharma of the hospitable ones. 
12.2 Maheśvara spoke: 
     Hear the ultimate Dharma of harmlessness and that of the hospitable ones. 
     O beautiful-eyed goddess, all the three worlds are full of wealth. 
12.3 [That wealth or] gifts to [a Brahmin who] knows the four Vedas cannot be compared to somebody who avoids doing harm. 
     Hear [now] the Dharma of the hospitable ones. I'll teach it [to you], o beautiful one. 
     ******************* 
     The Story of Vipula 
     ******************* 
     This is an old story of what happened once in a city called Kusuma. There was a famous wise man called Vipula, Kapila's son. 
12.5 He always followed the Dharma, he conquered anger, and he spoke only the truth. He also conquered his senses. 
     He was a true Brahmin. He was knowledgable and he was my determined devotee. 
12.6 He was rich and he worshipped his guests. He was generous, restrained, and pitiful. 
     He wealth always came through legal transactions, never illegally. 
12.7 He had a beautiful wife whose face was as pure as the disc of the moon. 
     Her breast were round and elevated, she was lovely and she was always a source of pleasure. 
12.8 She was faithful, devoted to her husband and his needs. 
     Now, once there was an eclipse of the sun. 
12.9 Three quarters [of the sun] were overshadowed, and it was in the dark half of the month Mādhava. 
      Eager to take a ritual bath, the king and all citizens went down [to the river]. 
12.10 They worshipped the gods and the deceased ancestors according to rule. 
      Some sacrificed in the fire, some fed the Brahmins, 
12.11 some gave donations, others praised the deities. 
      Some people practised yoga meditation, others were engrossed in five-fire penance. 
12.12 While all the royals and other people were doing this all around, 
      Vipula too, there at the confluence of the Gaṅgā and the Gaṇḍakī, 
12.13 together with his wife, performed a bath, and, attired in linen clothes, 
      was satiating the deities, the gurus and the Brahmins and others. 
12.14 Then, jumping on the possibility, a Brahmin came up [to them] as a guest. 
12.109 I went to Soma's world, and he gave me the magical fruit. 
12.110 I cannot give you another one. Go now to Soma's city. 
       Gāyatrī, who is the mother of the Vedas, and beautiful Sāvitrī. 
16.1 ******************* 
     The exposition of the essence of yoga 
     ******************* 
     Devī spoke: 
     Now I would like to hear the exposition of the essence of yoga. 
     Furthermore teach me about the Karaṇa, according to the rules, oh Sureśvara. 
16.2 Īśvara spoke: 
     Listen, o Devī, I shall teach you the supreme essence of yoga, 
     by knowing which people will cease to experience the fetter of mundane existence. 
16.3 [One can be] a Brahmin-slayer, a violator of his teacher's bed, a drunkard, a thief 
     or can be born into a mixed caste: it [i.e. yoga] will eliminate all [of his sins]. 
16.4 He who engages in Prāṇāyāma for half a moment or for a moment, 
     [and] focuses on the object to be visualized (dhyeya) will have his sins destroyed ... [kṣaṇāt? cf. parallel]  
16.5 Mighty Yama, the cruel Ender, frightening-looking death 
     will not take possession of the brave yogin. 
16.6 Just as the diseases of all dhātus are burnt by ... 
     in the same way his sins burn away if he controlls his breath. 
16.7 There is nothing like a thousand Aśvamedha sacrifice, a hundred Rājasūya ritual 
     or a hundred [rounds of] prāṇāyāma. 
16.8 By sacrifice, one can reach the gods. The result of asceticism is sovereignty. 
     By the renunciation of the world, one gets to the Brahman's world, and by indifference to life, to Prakṛti's abode.  
16.9 By knowledge, one attains kaivalya and the supreme and eternal Brahman. 
      These are taught to be the five paths according to the rules. 
16.10 If the knower of yoga practises yoga for half a moment or for a moment, 
      he will be delivered from all sins and will attain immortality. 
16.11 Even if he practises diligently, while he does not know the tattva, 
      he will surely abide in Brahmā's and Viṣṇu's homes, o Sundarī. [?] 
16.12 Having all possible desires, he will experience thousands of karma. 
      Then his merits are exhausted, he will be born in the world of mortals, in a noble family. 
16.13 If he practises only yoga, he will be a man who remembers his own previous births. 
      Crossing the ocean of mundane existence, he will obtain Śivaness. 
      ******************* 
      The technique of yoga 
      ******************* 
16.14 Devī spoke: 
      I wish to hear about the method of yoga. Teach me, o Puruṣottama, o Sureśvara, about 
      [the methods] of meditation, concentration and of [obtaining] Powers. 
16.15 Maheśvara spoke: 
      Listen, I shall teach you the method of yoga, which is the destruction of the noose of existence. 
      [With his body] purified and his mind concentrated, he should sit down on assuming a sitting posture (āsana) in a place which is devoid of human voices,  
16.16 and he should think of the Supreme Soul. 
      [The āsanas are:] padmaka, svastika, niṣkala, añjali, 
16.17 ardhacandra, daṇḍa, paryaṅka, and bhadra. 
      He should practise yoga by assuming [any one of] these āsanas. 
16.18 His trunk, head and neck should be in a line and he should be motionless while he concentrates. 
      Withdrawal of the senses (pratyāhāra), meditation (dhyāna), breat-controll (prāṇayāma), concentration (dhāraṇā), 
16.19 reflection (tarka), and samādhi: these are called six-limbed yoga. 
      That [method] which draws in the senses that are clinging on to the objects again and again 
16.20 with the help of the mind is called withdrawal of the senses.  
      O Devī, [the yogin] should hold the [five] sense-objects beginning with sound [in his focus] after he has made them into a ball. 
16.21 His passions gone, dwelling in samādhi, he should join the object of meditation with the with the subtsance. 
      The Self is the meditator (dhyātṛ), the mind is meditation (dhyāna), the object of meditation (dhyeya) is Pure Supreme Śiva 
16.22 As regards supreme sovreignty, there is one means. 
      Inhalation, breath retention, then exhalation, 
16.23 and the tranquillized one: prāṇāyāma is fourfold.  
      [By] inhalation the wise one establishes the fire through his great-toe. 
16.24 By breath retention he should stop iti [i.e. the fire] and visualize it [i.e. himself] as being burnt. 
      Then, while exhaling, he should imagine himeself as reduced to ashes. 
16.25 Now his Self has a purified body, one which is as spotless as a clear crystal.  
      [When this is maintained for] twelve measures of time, that is called nirvāṇa 
16.26 Concentration (dhāraṇā) is twice as long as breath-control (prāṇāyāma), there is no doubt about it. 
      As regards yoga, it (dhāraṇā?) is said to be three times as long, in saṃkrama it is four times longer. 
16.27 As far as ritual suicide (utkrānti) is concerned, it is five times longer. Yoga Power (yogasiddhi) is six times longer.  
      [The yogin should] always be practising yoga with the six ancilliaries. 
16.28 Yoga is taught as having two forms: mental (mānasa) and simultaneous?? (yaugapadya). 
      [The yogin] can meditate on the supreme subtle one only mentally, without performing breath-control: 
16.29 that type of yoga is called mental [yoga] (mānasa). 
      [If the yogin] controls his breath with his mind, and his mind with breath-control, 
16.30 and thus meditates on the supreme subtle one, that is called simultaneous [yoga] (yaugapadya). 
      I shall teach you the signs of success in yoga, listen, o Sundarī. 
16.31 Conch-shell, kettle-drum, mṛdaṅga-drum, flute, dundubhi-drum: 
      [when these are] beaten, he does not perceive [the sound] when he has reached such-ness [i.e. Śivaness]. 
16.32 Similarly, he will not be able to tell cold from heat, joy from sadness, he will not experience thirst or hunger or pain 
      when he attains success in yoga, o Sundarī. 
16.33 This is how I taught the technique of yoga in a nutshell, o Devī, because you asked me, o Sundarī. 
      What else shall I teach you? 
16.34 Devī spoke: 
      Tell me about the liberation from mundane existence without yoga, o Deveśa!  
      O Mahādeva, [that could] free [one's] mind of doubts. 
16.35 Maheśvara spoke: 
      Sighing is Sadāśiva, a deep breath is supreme Śiva. 
      In between the two, there is Śiva the supreme and imperishable Self. 
16.36 For one [who knows this], there is neither yoga meditation and nor karaṇa. 
      He is liberated by mere knowledge. What else do you want to ask? 
16.37 I shall teach you another kind of knowledge. Listen, o Devī, listen to me.  
      Listen in short to the expositions that are included in the five sciences, 
      in Sāṃkhya, in yoga, in the Pañcarātra, in Śaivism and in the Vedas. 
16.38 The quintessential yoga which is established in Sāṃkhya, and which is for [liberation from] the terrible ocean of mundane existence, 
      and which I am teaching you now, 
      Is a certainly there for you in essential yoga [teachings], in the Pañcarātra, 
      in the Vedas, and in Śaivism. 
16.39 He whose mind and all combined? are dissolved, so to say, 
      in the senses beginning with smelling, 
      and who suppresses all sensations (bhāva) with his mind,  
      will attain his aim and will find refuge in Śiva. 
16.40 [When the yogin attains] motionlessness of all his senses beginning with hearing, 
      and his attention, controlled by his mind, becomes focused, 
      his body will empty out. 
      This is called `success in union' by the experts. 
16.41 First, having subdued the sense[s], the mind slowly ceases to function, 
      until it dissolves. Then [the yogin's] body is rendered unconscious by the mind(?). 
      Then(?) [the yogin] certainly attains full yoga, namely meditation and samādhi. 
      Why is it that there are some who do not seek after [this] essence extracted from ten thousand million books? 
16.42 He has conquered his joy in his Self, [instead] he rejoices in samādhi and he has also taken refuge in indifference (vairāgya). 
      When the end comes, his mind will remain [in] corporal form??? 
      That is to be known as the highest path, Śiva's abode, which puts an end to mundane suffering. 
      And this is grounded in the Vedānta (in the Upaniṣads?). When this has been told, why should anyone look into any other teaching? 
16.43 On the pericarp of the heart-lotus, the sun illuminates the intermediate space, 
      whose light [becomes(?)] a bright lamp because it is illuminated by the most dense rays of light (?tejamārga). 
      This pierces the mouth at the palate upwards, [then] through the palate towards the top of the head. 
      Those practising yoga leave for Śiva's supreme abode through another door on the top of their head. 
16.44 [Tentative:] The whole darkness is deep black. He who is greater is essentially the splendour of light.[???] 
      the supporter of the earth, the world and the non-world, husband to Śrī, abiding in the breath, 
      the imperishable creator, the imperishable cause,[?] he the all-pervading, the arranger?, ...?  
      Viṣṇu, ..., the lord of the universe, the omniscient one. 
21.1 Vigatarāga spoke: 
     Bravo, O best of the wise, bravo, O best of the ones who maintain Dharma!  
     Bravo self-control, bravo tranquillity! Bravo sacrifice, bravo penance! 
21.2 By this nectar-like speech [of yours], my amazement has risen considerably. 
     And I am pleased with the extraordinary flavour of knowledge based on penance. 
21.3 What kind of boon [shd be m.!] shall I give you? Tell me. I'll give you anything you desire. 
     Having heard this, he replied with the appropriate words. 
21.4 [Anarthayajña spoke:] 
     Who are you, O best of benefactors? Are you a god, a Dānava-demon or a Rākṣasa? 
     Or rather [you must be] Lord Viṣṇu, who has come to test me. 
21.5 I recognize you clearly, O best of men, O highest person! 
     Display your [true] Form, O Govinda, if penance can yield fruit. 
21.6 Then lotus-eyed Hari displayed his own [true] body, 
     holding in his hands a conch-shell, a discus and a mace, wearing yellow garments. 
21.7 Seeing him, Anarthayajña was truly amazed. 
     Thrilled by unequalled delight, his eyes filled with tears, 
21.8 his voice trembling, he finally was able to speak to Janārdana [i.e. Viṣṇu]. 
     My birth and my austerities have now borne their fruits. 
21.9 Obeisance to you who are the origin of man and other [living beings]! [?] 
     Obeisance to you who are the universe! 
     Obeisance to you who ???  
      Obeisance to you from whom Brahmā was born! 
21.10 Obeisance to you who have a thousand heads! 
      Obeisance to you who have a thousand eyes! 
      Obeisance to you who have a thousand liṅgas! 
      Obeisance to you who have a thousand chests! 
21.11 Obeisance to you who have a thousand embodiments! 
      Obeisance to you who have a thousand arms! 
      Obeisance to you who have a thousand faces! 
      Obeisance to you who have a thousand supernatural powers! 
21.12 Obeisance to you who assumed the form of a boar! 
      Obeisance to you who [in that form] dug out and saved the Earth! 
      Obeisance to you who create the living beings! 
      Obeisance to you on whom the four life-stages depend! 
21.13 Obeisance to you who assumed the form of the Man-lion! 
      Obeisance to you who [in that form] tore asunder the chest of Diti's son [Hiraṇyakaśipu]! 
      Obeisance to you who destroyed the armies [conj.] of the Asuras! 
      Obeisance to you who destroyed the Asuras' haughtiness! 
21.14 Obeisance to you who tamed Diti's son! 
      Obeisance to you who destroyed Bali's sacrifice! 
      Obeisance to you of the three steps/Trivikrama! 
      Obeisance to you who he drove away the pain of the thirty gods! 
21.15 Obeisance to you who are endless and imperishable! 
      Obeisance to you who drive away the pain of the world! 
      Obeisance to you who killed [the Asuras] Madhu and Kaiṭa[bha]! 
      Obeisance to you who are the friend of the three worlds! 
21.16 Obeisance to you who are the delight of the thirty gods! 
      Obeisance to you who possess divine vision! 
      Obeisance to you who has gone beyond the limits of existence! 
      Obeisance to you who are worshipped by the three worlds! 
21.17 Obeisance to you who hold a mace in [one of] your right[?] hand[s]! 
      Obeisance to you who hold a discus in your hand! 
      Obeisance to you who hold a conch-shell in your hand! 
      Obeisance to you who hold a conch-shell[? rather: lotus] in your hand! 
21.18 Obeisance to you who recline on the great waters! 
      Obeisance to you who have the form that crushed Hara [the Dānava?]! 
      Obeisance to you whose banner has the King of Birds [Garuḍa] [on it]! 
      Obeisance to you whose eyes are the Sun and the Moon! 
21.19 Obeisance to you whose vehicle is the Enemy of Serpents [i.e. Garuḍa]! 
      Obeisance to you who displays his extraordinary form! 
      Obeisance to you whose splendour is that of a hundred thousand suns! 
      Obeisance to you who was, [in your Kūrma-avatāra] the firm support at the churning out of the divine nectar! 
21.20 Obeisance to you who are praise in the world of immortals! 
      Obeisance to you who are the seat of the temple of the world! 
      Obeisance to you, the only one affectionate towards the world! 
      Obeisance to you who bestows happiness on everyone, obeisance! 
21.21 O Govinda, forgive my sin. 
      As you were asking me very actively, I, being a wicked person, 
      told you all this out of arrogance. 
      Have pity on me, Lord of the thirty gods [instr.?]. 
21.22 Vaiśampāyana spoke: 
      Keśava, the destroyer of the heroes of the enemy, was satisfied by this hymn of praise. 
      He, the great general, replied in a ... [nirupaspṛhā/spṛhayā] voice.  
21.23 I am satisfied by this hymn of praise of me, dear Sir. I am vehemently trembling [with joy]. 
      I'll grant you any boon you desire even if it is something difficult to obtain in the three worlds. 
21.24 [He who] praises me with this ....?  [hymn] 
      that you recited and which is fascinating because it contains the meaning of the Vedas, 
      will dwell in heaven for as many eons 
      as the number of syllables in it. 
21.25 And you should choose a boon at your pleasure, 
      beginning from sovereignty over the three worlds, fearlessly. 
      Shall I grant you sovereignty over the seven-fold[?] world? 
      Or a heap of gold? Or many girls? 
21.26 Hearing about the divine boon [offered] [em. to vacam?] by the imperishable one, 
      he bowed down to his lotus-feet. 
      Having recognized Viṣṇu as most generous, 
      with a delighted heart....[to be reconstructed] 
21.27 Anarthayajña spoke: 
      I do not desire anything else as a gift, O God. 
      The sole essence of bondage is [now] without doubt.[?] 
      I have been freed from this bondage by your Lordship's grace, 
      and, O Govinda, I am delighting in Dharma. 
21.28 The Lord spoke: 
      The extent to which your mind has been enlightened 
      O great sage, is something even the gods have never seen, 
      [this] spotless freedom from suffering. 
      The ocean of existence has certaily been crossed. 
21.29 Well, let's go now to the White Island, 
      which is hidden and is inaccessible even for the gods. 
      He who dies with his mind purified by devotion towards me, 
      will never again enter the dreadful ocean [of existence]. 
21.30 Vaiśampāyana spoke: 
      Having spoken thus, Hari took the great ascetic by the hand, 
      who disappeared in that moment, and with him Keśava, too. 
21.31 Thus, because of the power of the abundance of Dharma[?? in him?], 
      he reached world of the Highest Person, 
      of the one who is the origin of all living beings, and who is imperishable, 
      the eternal and never-ending [world] of the never-decaying. 
21.32 You yourself should be loyal to Keśava, 
      to Janārdana of unmeasurable heroism, 
      so that you can tread the path of that excellent Brahmin, 
      that excellent person. 
21.33 What else should I teach you further, O king, 
      if you have any more interest remaining? 
      Ask me, O Sir, whatever you want 
      regarding the future or the past, anything you wish, Sir. 
21.34 Janamejaya spoke: 
      How many past kalpas have passed until now? 
      How many are the future kalpas? 
      How many Indras are taught to exist with regard to each aeon? 
21.35 Vaiśampāyana spoke: 
      100,000 billions of aeons have passed so far [rājyam?]. 
      Fourteen Indras is a king's aeon. 
      And there is one Manvantara period. 
      The future aeons are again 100,000 billion. 
21.36 The first aeon was the Varāhakalpa. 
      Six Manvantaras have passed, ...  
      Seventy-one four-fold [Mahā]yugas make up 
      the [14] Manvantaras. 
21.37 Fourteen Manvantara-periods 
      is one Kalpa, say the sages. 
      Ten thousand Kalpas is Brahmā's day. 
      His night is the same according to the experts. 
21.38 Six hundred-thousand Kalpas is called a [cosmic] month. 
      Twelve of them is called a year. 
21.39 Brahmā's life is said to be that year multiplied by 100,000 billions of Kalpas[?] 
      But even Brahmā, the Lord of the three worlds, the supreme person, is taught to be transient. 
      Why should we grieve over the fate[?] of the soul of the four kinds of living beings? 
      Therefore there is nothing that is untouched by the final[?] essence of the world except for eternal Śiva.
