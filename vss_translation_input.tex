\translation{Having bowed to the One who has no beginning, no middle part and no end, whose boundaries are limitless, who is very subtle and who is the unmanifest and fine essence of the world, to the One who is wholly complete with Hari, Indra, Brahmā and the other [gods], I shall recite [the work called] `A Compendium on the Essence of the Bull [of Dharma]'. \blankfootnote{1.1 \textit{Pāda} a is reminiscent of, among other famous passages, \BHG\ 11.19:
  %
 \textit{anādimadhyāntam anantavīryam  
 anantabāhuṃ śaśisūryanetram |  
 paśyāmi tvāṃ dīptahutāśavaktraṃ  
 svatejasā viśvam idaṃ tapantam ||}.
  %
 See also \BHG\ 10.20cd:
  %
 \textit{aham ādiś ca madhyaṃ ca bhūtānām anta eva ca} ||.
  %
 
 A faint reference to the \BHG\ seems proper at the
 beginning of a work that claims to deliver a teaching 
 based on, but also to surpass, the \MBH\ {\rm (}see following verses of the \VSS{\rm )}.
 Compare also, e.g., \KURMP\ 1.11.237:
  %
  \textit{rūpaṃ tavāśeṣakalāvihīnam 
  agocaraṃ nirmalam ekarūpam |  
  anādimadhyāntam anantam ādyaṃ  
  namāmi satyaṃ tamasaḥ parastāt} ||.
  %
 To say that a god has no beginning and no end in a temporal or spacial sense is natural
 {\rm (}\textit{anādi°...°antam}{\rm )}, but to have no `middle part' {\rm (}\textit{°madhya°}{\rm )} in these senses is slightly less so.
 Thus the rather commonly occuring phrase \textit{anādimadhyāntam} is probably a fixed expression usually 
 referring to a deity that is endless, eternal and immaterial. 
 As to which deity or what form of a deity this stanza refers to, 
 it may be Śiva, his name missing in pāda c, but the phrasing of the verse 
 is vague enough to keep the question somewhat open: the impersonal Brahman 
 might be another option, even more so if we look at verses 1.9--10, whose
 topic is \textit{brahmavidyā}.
 
 
  %
 In \textit{pāda} b \textit{jagat-susāraṃ} is most probably not 
 to be interpreted as \textit{jagatsu sāraṃ} {\rm (}`the essence in the worlds'{\rm )}.
 Another way to translate \textit{avyaktajagatsusāraṃ} would be: 
 `who is the fine essence of the unmanifest world.'
 
  %
 Strictly speaking, \textit{pāda} c is unmetrical, but it is better to 
 simply acknowledge here the phenomenon of `muta cum liquida', namely
 that syllables followed by consonant clusters such as 
 \textit{ra, bra, hra, kra, śra, śya, śva, sva, dva} can be treated as short {\rm (}\textit{laghu}{\rm )}.
 {\rm (}See Introduction \CHECK{\rm )}
 Thus \textit{harīndrabrahmā°} can be treated as a regular beginning
 of an \textit{upajāti} {\rm (}\shortsyllable\ - \shortsyllable\ - -{\rm )}, the syllable 
 \textit{bra} not turning the previous syllable long {\rm (}\textit{guru}{\rm )}.
 
  %
 The reading \textit{āsamagraṃ} in \textit{pāda} c is suspect,
 although the initial \textit{ā-} might convey some sort of
 completeness, meaning `all round'
 {\rm (}see e.g. \mycitep{KaleHigherGrammar}{226}{\rm )}.
 The fact that we could percieve
 the ending of \textit{pāda}s a and b {\rm (}\textit{pāraṃ}--\textit{sāram}{\rm )}, 
 as well as \textit{pāda}s c and d, as {\rm (}in the latter case, oddly{\rm )} rhyming pairs {\rm (}\textit{graṃ}-\textit{graham}{\rm )}
 suggests that accepting the reading
 \textit{āsamagram} could be the right decision
 {\rm (}as suggested by Alessandro Battistini{\rm )}.
 I translate this verse accordingly. \msM\ gives an exciting,
 albeit unmetrical, alternative {\rm (}\textit{yat samagraṃ}{\rm )}, but
 this seems more like a guess to me than the correct reading.
 For some time I was considering emending \textit{āsamagraṃ}.
 The most tempting of all the possible options 
 {\rm (}\textit{arcyam/arhyam/arghyam/īḍyam/āḍhyam agraṃ, āsamastaṃ}{\rm )} 
 seemed to be \textit{āptam agraṃ},
 meaning `appointed/received/respected [by Hari, Indra,
 Brahmā etc.] as the foremost one'. The fact that 
 the \textit{akṣara}s \textit{āsam} and \textit{āptam} look similar in most
 of the scripts used in our manuscripts could support this
 conjecture. \textit{āptam} could also
 possibly refer to the text itself, although then the
 syntax becomes slightly confusing: `I shall recite the
 \textit{Vṛṣasārasaṃgraha} that was first received by Hari...' etc.
 Another candidate was \textit{āḍhyam agram}:
 `Having bowed to [Him] who contains/is rich with Hari, Indra, Brahmā
 etc.' I have not emended the text because it is difficult
 to know if there is any need for change and if there is, which reading 
 to chose. There was no consensus when this verse was discussed 
 in our extended Śivadharma reading group.
 
  %
 Pāda d seems hypermetrical, but it can be interpreted as a \textit{vaṃśastha}
 line, a change from \textit{triṣṭubh} to \textit{jagatī} {\rm (}as suggested by Dominic Goodall{\rm )}.

\translation{Janamejaya remained unsatisfied. Listen unweariedly to what he asked Vaiśampāyana in the past. \blankfootnote{1.3 My emendation from the unmetrical \textit{punaḥ} to the unusual, or rather, Middle Indic 
  {\rm (}\mycitep{EdgertonHybrid}{vol. 2, p. 347}{\rm )}, \textit{puna} is based
  on the assumption that in the original the metre must have overridden 
  morphology, similarily to what may have happened in 8.44d {\rm (}Mālinī metre{\rm )}:
  \textit{na bhavati punajanma kalpakoṭyāyute 'pi}, and in 12.151c {\rm (}Sragdharā metre{\rm )}:
  \textit{garbhāvāsaṃ na ca tvan na ca punamaraṇaṃ kleśam āyāsapūrṇam}.
 
   %
  For an unsatisfaction or dissatisfaction {\rm (}\textit{atṛpti}{\rm )} with previous 
  teachings in a somewhat similar manner to what
  Janamejaya experiences here, see e.g. \textit{Niśvāsa} mūla 1.9:
   %
  \textit{vedāntaṃ viditaṃ deva sāṃkhyaṃ vai pañcaviṃśakam |
  na ca tṛptiṃ gamiṣyāmo hy ṛte śaivād anugrahāt ||};
   %
  and the \SDhS\... \CHECK.
 Vaiśampāyana, a Ṛṣi, disciple of Vyāsa, great-grandson to Arjuna,
  recited the Mahābhārata at the snake sacrifice of 
  Janamejaya. This setting is an echo of the starting point of the Mahābhārata, see \MBH\ 1.1.8ff.
  In fact the next few verses in the \VSS\ make it clear that the \VSS\
  picks up where the Mahābhārata left off: Janamejaya has heard the whole Mahābhārata from
  Vaiśampāyana, but he is eager to hear more.
   %
  Note how we are forced to emend \textit{pāda} c to contain a stem form proper noun {\rm (}\textit{janamejaya}{\rm )}
  to maintain the metre, and note how the manuscripts struggle with this \textit{pāda}.
  Stem form nouns, \textit{prātipadika}s, abound in the \VSS: see Introduction p. \CHECK.

  Therefore I have chosen \textit{dharmaṃ vā yad}, in which \textit{vā} functions probably in a weak sense.
  That the secret Dharma Janamejaya is seeking is the one taught by Vyāsa Dvaipāyana, and
  thus no real options are involved here, becomes clear in 1.6cd.
  The reading of \msM\ in \textit{pāda} b {\rm (}\textit{dharmavākyaṃ}{\rm )} is tempting but could be a later correction.
 In general, \msM's readings here are unique but probably secondary: \textit{hi me tṛptiṃ} in \textit{pāda} c seems more

  a hundred thousand. That the number refers to the number of \textit{śloka}s
  transmitted, and not, e.g., the number of lines, is confirmed in 1.66d:
  \textit{viṃśatślokasahasrikam}.

  Manuscripts \msCc\ and \msM\ place the \textit{iti} of the colophon at the end of the last \textit{śloka}, before

  Note also that \msM\ gives the number of \textit{śloka}s in this chapter, 77, which is almost exactly
  the number of verses this critical edition has produced. The scribe of \msM\ struggled 
  with eyeskips in this chapter, therefore it seems unlikely that he himself
  counted the number of verses he had copied and arrived at this very figure.
  Rather, he copied the number from his exemplar.

  Note the similarities of \MBH\ this passage with this chapter: the phrase \textit{dharma ity āhur},
  the fact that the present chapter from verse 18 on is actually a chapter on \textit{ahiṃsā},
  and that the etimological explanation involves the word [\textit{ā}]\textit{dhāraṇa} in
  both cases. These lead me to think that in \textit{pāda}s ab of this verse in the \VSS,
  it is Dharma that is the focus of the inquiry and not the bull.
 
  
 Understand \textit{pāda} d as \textit{gatayas tasya kati smṛtāḥ}. I have accepted
  \textit{smṛtāḥ} because this plural signals that \textit{gatis} is meant to be plural,
  similarly to what happens in 3.6cd {\rm (}\textit{tasya patnī... mahābhāgāḥ}{\rm )}.

  \textit{prasūtisambhavāḥ} in \textit{pāda} d is a rather bold conjecture that can be supported by two facts:
  firstly, the readings of the manuscripts are difficult to make sense of and thus are
  probably corrupt; secondly, a corruption from the name Prasūti,
  traditionally the name of Dakṣa's wife, to \textit{ābhūti}
  is relatively easily to explain, \textit{sū} and \textit{bhū} being close enough in some scripts 
  {\rm (}e.g. in \msCa{\rm )} to cause confusion. Another option would be to accept 
  Ābhūti as the name of Dakṣa's wife.

  `\thinspace ``Scripture'' should be recognized as ``Veda,'' and ``tradition''

  There may be a hiatus filler in \textit{pāda}s cd: \textit{°sambandha-m-ijyā} for \textit{°sambandha ijyā}.

 I understand \textit{vipule} as \textit{vipulāyāṃ}, \textit{vipulā} appearing in \Amara\ 2.1.7 as a synonym of

  This is still problematic because both human and

  Māndhātṛ was born from his father's body who, being excessively thirsty once,
  had drank some decoction prepared for ritual purposes and as a result become pregnant with him.
  Nevertheless, \BUDDHACARITA\ 11.13 suggests that Māndhātṛ himself was still unsatisfied

  the story of King Māndhātar, which appears 47 times.'

  Nahuṣa was elevated to the position of Indra for a period of time and he also wanted
  to take Śacī, Indra's wife. Indra instructed Śacī to tell Nahuṣa to 
  harness some Ṛsis to a vehicle and use this vehicle to take Śacī. 
  Agastya, one of the Ṛṣis, was insulted even further by Nahuṣa, therefore
  he cursed Nahuṣa, who then fell from the vehicle. See \MBH\ 12.329.35 ff. and

\translation{[By] the wise one['s applying] the six soft and sweet juices, [which are] the six flavours in food, the disturbances of the \textit{dhātu}s will disappear and the terrible illnesses will not arise. \blankfootnote{5.11 The readings may suggest that \textit{pāda} b contains \textit{sadrava} or maybe \textit{sudrava}, but it is difficult to make
  sense of the sentence. We are lacking a verb; \textit{āhāra} might be wrong for \textit{āharet} {\rm (}see \msM{\rm )}.
  The Āyurvedic implications of this clumsy verse are obscue to me. What is clear is that traditionally there are
  six basic flavours or `juices' in food. See, e.g. \BHELAS\ 1.28.1:
  \textit{yad bhakṣayati bhuṅkte vā vidhivac cāpi mānavaḥ |
  anyac ca kiñcit pibati tat sarvaṃ ṣaḍrasānvitam ||.}
  {\rm (}`All that a human eats or enjoys according to the rules, and furthermore all 
  that he or she drinks, is endowed with the six flavours.'{\rm )}
  To repair \textit{pāda}s ab, one should perhaps imagine that the intended meaning was that the
  six flavours/juices should be present in a harmonious proportion in a wise man's food. Cf. \BHELAS\ 3.1.1:
  \textit{śarīraṃ dhārayantīha ṣaḍrasāḥ samam āhṛtāḥ |
  ato 'nyathā vikārāṃs tu janayanti śarīriṇām ||.}
  {\rm (}`The six flavours will support the body in this world when brought to a balanced state.
  Otherwise they will produce defects to people.'{\rm )}
 On \textit{dhātuvaiṣamya}, see, e.g., \CARAKA\ 1.9.4:
  \textit{vikāro dhātuvaiṣamyaṃ sāmyaṃ prakṛtir ucyate |
  sukhasaṃjñakam ārogyaṃ vikāro duḥkham eva ca ||}
  {\rm (}`The imbalance of the \textit{dhātu}s means defects. Balance is said to be natural.
  Health is happiness, defects are suffering.'{\rm )}

  this observance is that Śiva's Bhairava form often has a dog as his mount. See, e.g.,
  \mycitep{BakkerWorld2014}{232--233} on a 5-6th-century image of Bhairava and a dog carved in
  rock at Muṇḍeśvarı̄ Hill not far from Vārāṇasī, and Mirnig 2013, 334 ?\verify 
  This observance has ancient roots. Its practitioner, the \textit{kukkuravatika}
  appears in \textit{Majjhimanikāya} 2.1.7, in the \textit{Kukkuravatiyasutta}, 
  alongside with a practitioner of the \textit{govrata} {\rm (}\textit{govatika}{\rm )}, an observance
  that comes up in the next verse in the \VSS:
  \textit{evaṃ me sutaṃ. ekaṃ samayaṃ bhagavā koliyesu viharati haliddavasanaṃ nāma koliyānaṃ nigamo.
  atha kho puṇṇo ca koliyaputto govatiko, acelo ca seniyo kukkuravatiko yena bhagavā tenupasaṅkamiṃsu...}
  See \mycitep{AcharyaBull}{127--128}. Acharya 
  summarises the \textit{Kukkuravatiyasutta} thus:
  `The \textit{Kukkuravatiyasutta} from the \textit{Majjhimanikāya} {\rm (}II.1.7{\rm )} 
  presents a \textit{govatika} together with a \textit{kukkuravatika}. They are observing 
  their vows, and have adopted the behaviour of a bull and a dog respectively. 
  The Buddha tells them that as they are cultivating bullness and dogness, 
  the state of mind of these animals, they will go to hell or become reborn as animal.
  They are alarmed at this and take refuge in the Buddha.'

  one either in stem form {\rm (}\msCa\msCb\msNa\msNc\msP{\rm )} or as \textit{bhīmas} {\rm (}\msCc\msNb\Ed{\rm )}
  or \textit{bhīmaṃ} {\rm (}\eme{\rm )},
  to reading these two words as a compound because
  of the following \textit{caiva}.
  I suspect that both \textit{bhīma} and \textit{tuṣṭikara} refer to the \textit{vrata}, rather than its practitioner,
  but I have not emended \textit{bhīmas tuṣṭikaraś} to \textit{bhīmaṃ tuṣṭikaraṃ}
  because \textit{vrata} appears as a masculine noun, e.g., in 8.17d below.
 
  \mycite{AcharyaBull} gives a number of significant clues about the origins 
  of this observance. After exploring its links to Pāśupatas, \mycitep{AcharyaBull}{116--118},
  quotes \textit{Jaiminīyabrāhmaṇa} 2.113, which contains the phrase 
  \textit{yatra yatrainaṃ viṣṭhā vindet tat tad vitiṣṭheta}, in Acharya's translation:
  `Wherever he feels the urge to evacuate f\ae ces, right there he should evacuate.'
  This is an instruction in a Vedic text that is close to what the \VSS\ teaches above.
  Incidentaly, the \textit{Jaiminīyabrāhmaṇa} adds:
  \textit{tena haitenottaravayasy e} [\textit{va}] \textit{yajeta}
  {\rm (}translated in \mycitep{AcharyaBull}{118} as:

\translation{Splitting [the earth] with spades and laid on hundreds of pointed wedges: Goddess Earth bears [this] patiently. This is exactly how one can practise the earth vow. \blankfootnote{8.17 While \textit{dārayanto} as an active participle in the masculine nominative is acceptable
  as an irregular form, the precise interpretation of \textit{pāda}s a and b is still problematic therefore
  my translation of this verse is tentative and the description seems too condensed to be
  intelligible. Kengo Harimoto suggested that \msCc\ and \Ed\ might be transmitting
  the correct reading, and then the reference would be to soil 
  piled up by millions of insects {\rm (}\textit{kīṭakoṭi}°{\rm )}, instead of points of
  wedges {\rm (}\textit{kīlakoṭi}°{\rm )}. Nevertheless, now I think that the reference point could
  be Bhīṣma's dying scene in the \MBH, where the great warrior is lying on a bed of hundreds of arrows: 
  \textit{sa śete śaratalpastho medinīm aspṛśaṃs tadā}: `Then he lay there on his bed of arrows,
  without touching the ground' {\rm (}\MBH\ 6.115.8ab{\rm )}. The word \textit{cita} is used in the same context in 
  \MBH\ 12.47.4ab: \textit{vikīrṇāṃśur ivādityo bhīṣmaḥ śaraśataiś citaḥ}: 
  `Bhīṣma, laid on a hundred arrows, was like the Sun with its scattered rays of light.'
  If this interpretation of \VSS\ 8.17 is correct, the observance described here may require
  one to dig the ground, install wedges, and lie on them, in the manner of fakirs.
  The reference to the Earth in \textit{pāda} c may have been inspired by lines such as \MBH\
  6.115.11cd: \textit{rarāsa pṛthivī caiva bhīṣme śāṃtanave hate}:
  `The Earth cried out when Bhīṣma, the son of Śaṃtanu, was killed.'
 
  In \BHAVP\ 4.121, called `The Description of eighty-five observances' {\rm (}\textit{vratapañcāśītivarṇana}{\rm )},
  we find this on \textit{mahīvrata}:
  \textit{dadyāt triṃśatpalād ūrdhvaṃ mahīṃ kṛtvā tu kāṃcanīm |
  kulācalādrisahitāṃ tilavastrasamanvitām || 152 || 
  tiladroṇopari gatāṃ brāhmaṇāya kuṭuṃbine | 
  dinaṃ payovratas tiṣṭhed rudraloke mahīyate || 153 || 
  etan mahīvrataṃ proktaṃ saptakalpānuvartakam |}.
 
  A tentative translation of this passage would go as follows: `One should donate a golden [model of] Earth
  that weighs more than thirty \textit{pala}s {\rm (}appr. one kilogram{\rm )}, showing the chief mountain-ranges,
  together with [donations of] sesamum seeds and clothes, the sesamum seeds [weighing] more than
  a \textit{droṇa} {\rm (}appr. ten kilograms{\rm )}, to a householder Brāhmin. One should keep the milk-observance 
  [i.e. subsisting on nothing but milk] for one day, and one will have fun in Rudraloka.
  This is called the Earth Observance whose range is seven \ae ons.' {\rm (}I take the values for weights
  from \mycitep{OlivelleManu}{997}.{\rm )} 
  The descriptions of the \textit{dharāvrata} and the \textit{śubhadvādaśī} observance in 
  \mycitep{KaneHistory}{v. 5, 321 and 429} are similar.
  The \VSS's \textit{mahīvrata} seems different, and more in line with 
  the somewhat transgressive and wild, perhaps Pāśupata-oriented, nature of the
  four preceding observances.

 There are two stem form nouns in \textit{pāda} b: I suspect that \Ed\ is right

  \textit{nigaditas}, which is trasmitted in all the witnesses;

  Take \textit{etan/etad} as either picking up °\textit{pahārī} or rather
  a plural corresponding to °\textit{pañcāśad}. The latter phenomenon, namely the use of
  the singular after numbers, is one of the hallmarks of the text.

\translation{Vigatarāga spoke: What does the term `the three times' mean for an embodied creature that is made up of three constituents {\rm (}\textit{dhātuka}{\rm )}? Teach me about this in a somewhat more extended manner, O great ascetic. \blankfootnote{9.2 I have included the element \textit{trai°} in the lemma in \textit{pāda}s ab only because \msCc\ 
  has a slightly unusual ligature there {\rm (}\textit{mtrai}{\rm )}. 
  
  As for the interpretation of
  \textit{traidhātuka} in \textit{pāda} b, an intelligent guess would be a reference to the three so-called
  `humours' of the body, namely \textit{pitta, vāyu/anila/vāta}, and \textit{śleṣman}.
  These are discussed later in, e.g., \VSS\ 23:31--32ab, in the context of types of sleep:
  \textit{śleṣmapittānilasthāne trīṇi pakṣāṇi vāsinaḥ |
  tamaḥ śleṣmāśrayā nidrā rajonidrā tu vātikā ||
  pittāśrayāṃ smṛtāṃ nidrāṃ sāttvikāṃ viddhi bhūpate |}.
 
  \MBH\ 12.330.21--22ab clearly states that the three \textit{dhātu}s, \textit{pitta, śleṣma} and \textit{vāyu},
  keep the body alive:
  \textit{trayo hi dhātavaḥ khyātāḥ karmajā iti ca smṛtāḥ |
  pittaṃ śleṣmā ca vāyuś ca eṣa saṃghāta ucyate ||
  etaiś ca dhāryate jantur etaiḥ kṣīṇaiś ca kṣīyate |}.
 
  The present verse in the \VSS\ contains the only occurence 
  of the term \textit{traidhātuka} in the text.
  In 5.11cd, \textit{dhātu} is probably used in the same Ayurvedic sense 
  that I am proposing here {\rm (}\textit{dhātuvaiṣamyanāśo 'sti na ca rogāḥ sudāruṇāḥ}{\rm )}.
  Elsewhere \textit{dhātu} means `verbal root' {\rm (}3.3{\rm )}, `metal' {\rm (}16.6: 
  \textit{yathā vai sarvadhātūnāṃ doṣā dahyanti dhāmyatām | 
  tathā pāpāḥ pradahyante dhruvaṃ prāṇasya nigrahāt} ||{\rm )},
  and `gross element' {\rm (}for Sāṃkhya-style \textit{mahābhūta}s in chapter 20{\rm )}.
  To slightly complicate things, chapter thirteen claims that the human body is made up
  of two \textit{dhātu}s, \textit{somadhātu} and \textit{agnidhātu}. Semen contains \textit{somadhātu},
  menstrual blood \textit{agnidhātu}, and the new-born baby is thus made up of both. See e.g. 13.20cd--13.21:
  \textit{śukraśoṇitasaṃyogād garbhotpattis tataḥ smṛtaḥ~||}
  \textit{agnisomātmakaṃ devi śarīradvayadhātutaḥ~|}

  It is also possible that the third tube is there, as Prayāga, in our obscure \VSS\ 10.17cd,

  The association of Lake Mānasa on Mount Kailāsa with lotuses, and especialy with geese or swans, is
  well-known. See, e.g., \MBH\ 6.114.90ff: Gaṅgā sends the great sages, who inhabit
  Lake Mānasa in the form of geese, to visit the dying Bhīṣma.

  Ghaṇṭīśa, Mahāghaṇṭeśvara or Mahāghaṇṭa Bhairava {\rm (}\mycitep{SandersonSaivaAge}{113, n. 241}{\rm )}.
  See Introduction \verify.
 
  As for the yogic interpretation of this verse, it seems plausible that \textit{ghaṇṭikā} is
  taken here as the uvula, from which \textit{amṛta} is said to be dripping down the throat.
  See \TAKII\ s.v. \textit{ghaṇṭikā} and \mycite{MallinsonKhecari}.

  The teaching on sacrifice without materials {\rm (}\textit{vinārthena yajñaḥ} or \textit{anarthayajñaḥ}{\rm )},

  all the similarly positioned stem form nouns in the following verses because there are no
  metrical constrains that would prevent us from doing it,
  but it seems to me that there is a pattern here and these stem forms
  give the impression of being emphasised, highlighted, or being items in a list
  {\rm (}see 11.14c and d, 15a, 16a and b, 17a, 18d, etc.{\rm )}. Nevertheless,
  some of the expression in the upcoming verses should be interpreted as bahuvrīhis
  qualifying the sacrificer/yogin. In fact, we could read \textit{yajñavāṭakurukṣetraḥ} and
  \textit{pratyāhāramahāvediḥ} as bahuvrīhis here.
 
  Kurukṣetra was defined as an internalised pilgrimage place in 10.12, which
  fits well the presently introduced teaching of internalised sacrifice.
  Both are summarised, together with bodily penance, in 13.2 as:
  \textit{svaśarīrasthito yajñaḥ svaśarīre sthitaṃ tapaḥ |
  svaśarīre sthitaṃ tīrthaṃ śruto vistarato mayā ||}.
  The term \textit{sattvāvāsa} has elsewhere, but probably not here, a distinctively Buddhist flavour,
  denoting the seven or nine `abodes of beings,' see, e.g. 
  \mycitep{EdgertonHybrid}{vol.~2, s.v. \textit{sattvāvāsa}}, and
  \mycitep{SferraTorellaVolArticle}{1155}.
 Note that if \textit{pāda} c followed the pattern of \textit{pāda} a, namely that `X in Vedic ritual is now Y in this
  internalised sacrifice,' we would need to read \textit{mahāvedi pratyāhāra}, but that would be unmetrical.
 
  While \textit{saṃyama} is mentioned only a few times in the \VSS\ {\rm (}e.g., in a similar

\translation{The Brahmakūrca [observance] is the [state of mind called] `beyond the Qualities' {\rm (}\textit{guṇātīta}{\rm )}, the scent of the sacrifice is the `spotless' {\rm (}\textit{nirañjana}{\rm )} [state of mind]. [His] sacred thread is the three truths {\rm (}\textit{tattva}{\rm )}. The shaven head [of the \textit{snātaka}] is [now] enlightenment. \blankfootnote{11.22 Note the stem form nouns in \textit{pāda}s ab.
 
  On the \textit{brahmakūrca} observance, see, e.g., \mycitep{KaneHistory}{vol.~4, 146},
  where the references given include \MITAKSARA\ ad \YAJNS\ 3.314: 
  \textit{yadā punaḥ pūrvedyur upoṣyāparedyuḥ samantrakaṃ saṃyujya

  `And when one fasts one day, and on the next day mixes the five products of the cow
  together while reciting mantras, and drinks [the mixture] while reciting mantras again,
  that is called \textit{brahmakūrca}.'
  
  On the \textit{guṇātīta} state of mind, see 9.39--43. See the term \textit{nirañjana} mentioned
  as a quality of the soul {\rm (}\textit{jīva}{\rm )} in 1.11 and 15.4, of the \textit{puruṣa} in 20.3, 
  as a state of mind in 11.49, and as one of ten meditative states in 22.30.
 
  
 It is difficult to know what are the three \textit{tattva}s mentioned in \textit{pāda} c.
  {\rm (}Understand \textit{trayas tattvaṃ} as \textit{tattvatrayaṃ}, \textit{trīṇi tattvāni}, \textit{tritattvāni}, or
  \textit{tritattvaṃ}.{\rm )}
  \VSS\ chapter 4 teaches four \textit{tattva}s as objects of meditation:
  \textit{ātman}, \textit{vidyā}, \textit{bhava}, and \textit{sūkṣma} {\rm (}see, e.g., 4.73{\rm )}. \VSS\ chapter 6
  discusses five \textit{tattva}s: \textit{sūrya}, \textit{soma}, \textit{agni}, \textit{sphaṭika}, and \textit{sūkṣma} 
  {\rm (}see, e.g., 6.7{\rm )}. \VSS\ chapter 20 enumerates the 25 \textit{tattva}s of Sāṃkhya.
  Dominic Goodall has tentatively suggested reading here in 11.22c, with \msNa,
  \textit{brahmasūtratrayaṃ tattvaṃ} {\rm (}`the three strands of the sacred thread is truth'{\rm )}.
  The problem is firstly that we have \textit{trayas tattvaṃ} repeated in 11.29c below, 
  and secondly that what we need here is three entities compared to the three strands
  of the sacred thread. What is clear here is that even the investiture of the
  sacred thread {\rm (}\textit{upanayana}{\rm )} is supposed to be internalised in this teaching
  of non-material sacrifice.

\translation{The four Vedas are [now] \textit{nivṛtti} etc. His seat is the four \textit{prakaraṇa}s. He should always perform a[n internalised] sacrifice after donating the priestly fee of providing being[s] with freedom from danger. \blankfootnote{11.23 My assumption is that \textit{pāda} a here hints at those four, later five, categories,
  called \textit{kalā}s, that are well-known from Tantric Śaivism: 
  \textit{nivṛtti}, \textit{pratiṣṭhā}, \textit{vidyā}, \textit{śānti}, and \textit{śāntyatīta}.
  For this, I had to emend the reading found in all witnesses consulted, \textit{nivṛtyā}°.
  I consider \textit{nivṛti} for \textit{nivṛtti} a common and plausible error. 
  As Dominic Goodall has suggested, here the four \textit{kalā}s, 
  originally possibly the four Śaktis of the Lord, may be reinterpreted as yogic states.
  The fact that the \VSS\ is aware of only four \textit{kalā}s here may hint at a relatively
  early date of composition of this section {\rm (}see Introduction pp. \verify{\rm )}.
  On the history and interpretation of these \textit{kalā}s,
  see \TAKII\ s.v. \textit{kalā} 6.
 
  \textit{catuḥprakaraṇāsanaḥ} may be taken as \textit{catuḥprakaraṇāṇy āsanam}, or, as I take it in my
  translation, a bahuvrīhi compound qualifying the practitioner. As to
  what the four \textit{prakaraṇa}s {\rm (}`chapters'?{\rm )} refer to here, I am without a clue.
  Perhaps the phrase was meaningful in a context where this section was
  taken out. {\rm (}The \textit{Mokṣopāya}, a text of Kashmiri origin and
  made up of \textit{prakaraṇa}s would be an interesting candidate for being a point of reference.
  Unfortunately, there are six \textit{prakaraṇa}s in the \textit{Mokṣopāya}, and not four.
  See, e.g., \mycite{SlajeMoksopaya1996}\index{Moksopaya@\textsl{Mo\-kṣo\-pā\-ya}}.

 \textit{ayam} as the end of this verse may have been the original reading and
  \msCb\ may have corrected it to \textit{adaḥ}. Another possibility is that
