\translation{Having bowed to the One who has no beginning, no middle part and no end, whose boundaries are limitless, who is very subtle and who is the unmanifest and fine essence of the world, and also to Indra, Brahmā and the other [gods], I shall recite [the work called] `A Compendium on the Essence of the Bull [of Dharma]'. \blankfootnote{1.1 This verse echoes \VSS\ 20.3:
 
  \textit{nādimadhyaṃ na cāntaṃ ca yan na vedyaṃ surair api}\thinspace | 
 
  \textit{atisūkṣmo hy atisthūlo nirālambo nirañjanaḥ\thinspace ||} 
 
  This could suggest
  that \textit{pāda} c above might be parallel with \textit{na vedyaṃ surair api}. 
  Perhaps understand \textit{asamagraṃ} [\textit{vedyaṃ}] {\rm (}`incompletely [known]{\rm )}.
 
  \textit{Pāda} a is also reminiscent of, among other famous passages, \BHG\ 11.19:
  
 
  \textit{anādimadhyāntam anantavīryam} 
  \textit{anantabāhuṃ śaśisūryanetram}\thinspace | 
 
  \textit{paśyāmi tvāṃ dīptahutāśavaktraṃ} 
  \textit{svatejasā viśvam idaṃ tapantam}\thinspace ||
  
 
  See also \BHG\ 10.20cd:
  
 
  \textit{aham ādiś ca madhyaṃ ca bhūtānām anta eva ca}\thinspace ||
  
 
  A faint reference to the \BHG\ seems proper at the
  beginning of a work that claims to deliver a teaching 
  based on, but also to surpass, the \MBH\ {\rm (}see following verses of the \VSS{\rm )}.
 
  Compare also, e.g., \KURMP\ 1.11.237:
  
 
  \textit{rūpaṃ tavāśeṣakalāvihīnam}
  \textit{agocaraṃ nirmalam ekarūpam}\thinspace |
  
  \textit{anādimadhyāntam anantam ādyaṃ} 
  \textit{namāmi satyaṃ tamasaḥ parastāt}\thinspace ||
  
 
  In general, to say that a god has no beginning and no end in a temporal or spacial sense is natural
  {\rm (}\textit{anādi \dots\ antam}{\rm )}, but to have no `middle part' {\rm (}\textit{madhya}{\rm )} in these senses is slightly less so.
  Thus the rather commonly occurring phrase \textit{anādimadhyāntam} is probably a fixed expression usually 
  referring to a deity that is endless, eternal and immaterial. 
  As to which deity or what form of a deity this stanza refers to, one could argue that 
  it is Śiva, his name missing in \textit{pāda} c, but the phrasing of the verse 
  is vague enough to keep the question somewhat open: the impersonal Brahman 
  might be another option, even more so if we look at verses 1.9--10, whose
  topic is \textit{brahmavidyā}.
 
 
  
 
  In \textit{pāda} b \textit{jagat-susāraṃ} is most probably not 
  to be interpreted as \textit{jagatsu sāraṃ} {\rm (}`the essence in the worlds'{\rm )}.
  Another way to translate \textit{avyaktajagatsusāraṃ} would be: 
  `who is the fine essence of the unmanifest world.'
 
  
 
  Strictly speaking, \textit{pāda} c is unmetrical, but it is better to 
  simply acknowledge here the phenomenon of `muta cum liquida', namely
  that syllables followed by consonant clusters such as 
  \textit{ra, bra, hra, kra, śra, śya, śva, sva, dva} can be treated as short {\rm (}\textit{laghu}{\rm )}.
  {\rm (}See Introduction pp.~\pageref{muta}\thinspace ff.{\rm )}
  Thus \textit{harīndrabrahmā}° can be treated as a regular beginning
  of an \textit{upajāti} {\rm (}\shortsyllable\ - \shortsyllable\ - -{\rm )}, the syllable 
  \textit{bra} not turning the previous syllable long {\rm (}\textit{guru}{\rm )}.
 
  
 
  The reading \textit{āsamagraṃ} in \textit{pāda} c is suspect 
  {\rm (}see a preliminary comment on this above{\rm )},
  although the initial \textit{ā-} might convey some sort of
  completeness, meaning `all round'
  {\rm (}see e.g. \mycitep{KaleHigherGrammar}{226}{\rm )}.
  The fact that we could perceive the ending of \textit{pāda}s a and b 
  {\rm (}\textit{pāraṃ}--\textit{sāram}{\rm )}, as well as \textit{pāda}s c and d, as {\rm (}in the 
  latter case, oddly{\rm )} rhyming pairs {\rm (}\textit{graṃ}-\textit{graham}{\rm )}
  suggests that accepting the reading \textit{āsamagram} could be 
  the right decision {\rm (}as suggested by Alessandro Battistini{\rm )}.
  I translate this verse accordingly. \msM\ gives an exciting,
  albeit unmetrical, alternative {\rm (}\textit{yat samagraṃ}{\rm )}, but
  this seems more of a guess than the correct reading.
  For some time I was considering emending \textit{āsamagraṃ}.
  The most tempting of all the possible options 
  {\rm (}\textit{arcyam/arhyam/arghyam/īḍyam/āḍhyam/āptam agraṃ, āsamastaṃ}{\rm )} 
  seemed to be \textit{āptam agraṃ},
  meaning `appointed/received/respected [by Hari, Indra,
  Brahmā etc.] as the foremost one'. The fact that 
  the \textit{akṣara}s \textit{āsam} and \textit{āptam} look similar in most
  of the scripts used in the witnesses could support this
  conjecture. \textit{āptam} could also
  possibly refer to the text itself, although then the
  syntax becomes slightly confusing: `I shall recite the
  \textit{Vṛṣasārasaṃgraha} that was first received by Hari...' etc.
  Another candidate was \textit{āḍhyam agram}:
  `Having bowed to [Him] who contains/is rich with Hari, Indra, Brahmā
  etc.' I have not emended the text because it is difficult
  to know if there is any need for change and if there is, which reading 
  to chose. There was no consensus when this verse was discussed 
  in our extended Śivadharma reading group.
 
  
 
  \textit{Pāda} d seems hypermetrical, but it can be interpreted as a \textit{vaṃśastha}
  line, a change from \textit{triṣṭubh} to \textit{jagatī} {\rm (}as suggested by Dominic Goodall{\rm )}.

\translation{Having listened to the \textit{Bhāratasaṃhitā} [i.e. the \textit{Mahābhārata}], the supreme book of a hundred thousand [verses] and a thousand chapters {\rm (}\textit{adhyāya}{\rm )}, with all its hundred sections {\rm (}\textit{parvan}{\rm )}, \blankfootnote{1.2 The dialogue of Janamejaya and Vaiśampāyana makes up the outermost layer of the \VSS\ 
  {\rm (}see Introduction p.~\pageref{structure}{\rm )}, mostly containing
  general \textit{dharmaśāstric} material.
  
 
  That the \MBH\ should contain a hundred thousand verses is hinted at, e.g., in line 19 of
  the Khoh Charter 2 of Śarvanātha, year 214 {\rm (}Siddham Database IN00088; 
  \textit{uktañ ca mahābhārate śatasāhasryaṃ} [understand °\textit{ryāṃ}] \textit{saṃhitāyāṃ}...{\rm )}.
  The hundred \textit{parvan}s of the \textit{Mahābhārata} are listed in \MBH\ 1.2.33--70.
  Note the use of the singular {\rm (}\textit{parva}{\rm )} in connection with numerals {\rm (}\textit{śataṃ}{\rm )},
  one of the hallmarks of this text {\rm (}see p.~\pageref{singularwithnumerals}{\rm )}.

  \maintext{janamejayena yat pūrvaṃ tac chṛṇu tvam atandritam }||\thinspace1:3\thinspace||%
\translation{Janamejaya remained unsatisfied. Listen attentively to what he asked Vaiśampāyana in the past. \blankfootnote{1.3 My emendation from the unmetrical \textit{punaḥ} to the unusual, or rather, Middle Indic
  {\rm (}\mycitep{EdgertonHybrid}{vol. 2, p. 347}{\rm )},
  and Newar {\rm (}\mycitep{JorgensenGrammar}{113}{\rm )}, \textit{puna} is based
  on the assumption that in the original the metre must have overridden 
  morphology, similarly to what may have happened in 8.44d {\rm (}Mālinī metre{\rm )}:
  \textit{na bhavati punajanma kalpakoṭyāyute 'pi}, and in 12.151c {\rm (}Sragdharā metre{\rm )}:
  \textit{garbhāvāsaṃ na ca tvan na ca punamaraṇaṃ kleśam āyāsapūrṇam}.
 
  
 
  For an unsatisfaction or dissatisfaction {\rm (}\textit{atṛpti}{\rm )} with previous 
  teachings in a somewhat similar manner to what
  Janamejaya experiences here, see, e.g., \textit{Niśvāsa} mūla 1.9:
  
 
  \textit{vedāntaṃ viditaṃ deva sāṃkhyaṃ vai pañcaviṃśakam}\thinspace |
 
  \textit{na ca tṛptiṃ gamiṣyāmo hy ṛte śaivād anugrahāt}\thinspace ||
  
 
  
 Vaiśampāyana, a Ṛṣi, disciple of Vyāsa, great-grandson to Arjuna,
  recited the \MBh\ at the snake sacrifice of 
  Janamejaya. This setting is an echo of the starting point of the \MBH, see \MBH\ 1.1.8ff.
  In fact the next few verses in the \VSS\ make it clear that the \VSS\
  picks up where the \MBH\ left off: Janamejaya has heard the whole \MBh\ from
  Vaiśampāyana, but he is eager to hear more, or rather a concise version
  of the Dharmic teachings of the \MBh.
  
 
  It is tempting to emend \textit{pāda} c to contain a stem form proper noun {\rm (}\textit{janamejaya}{\rm )}
  in order to maintain the metre, 
  and note how the manuscripts struggle with this \textit{pāda}. 
  Stem form nouns, \textit{prātipadika}s, abound in the \VSS: see Introduction p.~\pageref{stemform}.
  On the other hand, the contracted/syncopated form \textit{janmejaya} occurs, 
  e.g., in \BHAGP\ 12.06.16 and \BRAHMAVP\ 4.14.41 and 46. {\rm (}It is even
  lexicalised in \Monier{\rm )} 
  The hypermetrical form \textit{janamejayena}, and the construction finite verb + instrumental
  {\rm (}\textit{papraccha... janamejayena}{\rm )}, could be original; compare 1.8 and 4.75 below.
  Alternatively, 1.3cd could be taken as a separate, and elliptical,
  sentence standing for \textit{janamejayena yac chrutaṃ pūrvaṃ tac chṛṇu}.

  That the secret Dharma Janamejaya is seeking is the one taught by Vyāsa Dvaipāyana, and
  thus no real options are involved here, becomes clear in 1.6cd.
  The reading of \msM\ in \textit{pāda} b {\rm (}\textit{dharmavākyaṃ}{\rm )} is tempting but could be a later correction.
 In general, \msM's readings here are unique but probably secondary: 
  \textit{hi me tṛptiṃ} in \textit{pāda} c seems more attractive than \msM's

  \textit{brahmāṇḍasya pramāṇaṃ kati yojanāni vijñeyaṃ}.
  \textit{cāpitaṃ kvacit} in \textit{pāda} b in the witnesses is enigmatic.
  One may conjecture \textit{prāpitaṃ} {\rm (}perhaps: `is it available somewhere?'{\rm )}, 
  The intended form may have been \textit{jñātaṃ kenacit} {\rm (}`is it known by anyone?'{\rm )},
  or \textit{jñāpitaṃ} {\rm (}`is it disclosed somewhere?'{\rm )}. I have chosen the latter,

  Alternatively, \textit{pāda} a may have originally read \textit{purāṇāni sahasrāṇi},

  In \BrahmandaPur\ 3.4.67ab {\rm (}\textit{mayā caitat punaḥ proktaṃ putrāyāmitabuddhaye}, see note to

  This suggests that the reading \textit{romaharṣāya} in some of the MSS

  otherwise syntactically problematic reading {\rm (}\textit{romaharṣeṇa}{\rm )} that is more

  Supposing the former, in this case I accepted \msM's reading.
 Note that the extent of the transmitted text {\rm (}12,000 \textit{śloka}s{\rm )} has not changed since Trayyāruṇi

  Manuscripts \msCc\ and \msM\ place the \textit{iti} of the colophon at the end of the last \textit{śloka}, before
  the \textit{daṇḍa}s, thus: \textit{icchasīti}\thinspace ||O|| {\rm (}\msCc{\rm )} and \textit{icchasi iti}\thinspace ||o|| {\rm (}\msM{\rm )}.
  Note also that \msM\ gives the number of \textit{śloka}s in this chapter, 77, which is close to
  the number of verses this critical edition has produced. The scribe of \msM\ struggled 
  with eyeskips in this chapter, therefore it seems unlikely that he himself
  counted the number of verses he had copied and arrived at this very figure.
  Rather, he copied the number from his exemplar.

\translation{Vigatarāga spoke: Why do they call it Dharma? And how many embodiments {\rm (}\textit{mūrti}{\rm )} is it known to have? It is known as a bull: how many legs does it have? How many are its paths? \blankfootnote{3.1 For the correct interpretation of \textit{pāda} a, namely to decide whether these questions
  focus on the bull of Dharma {\rm (}`Why do they call the bull Dharma?'{\rm )} 
  or Dharma itself/himself {\rm (}`Why is Dharma called Dharma?'{\rm )}, see 
  the end of the previous chapter, where \textit{dharma} was mentioned {\rm (}2.40b{\rm )},
  and to which the present verse is a reaction, i.e. the focus is not so much the bull
  but Dharma. Compare also \MBH\ 12.110.10--11:
  
 
  \textit{prabhāvārthāya bhūtānāṃ dharmapravacanaṃ kṛtam}\thinspace |
 
  \textit{yat syād ahiṃsāsaṃyuktaṃ sa dharma iti niścayaḥ}\thinspace ||
 
  \textit{dhāraṇād dharma ity āhur dharmeṇa vidhṛtāḥ prajāḥ}\thinspace |
 
  \textit{yat syād dhāraṇasaṃyuktaṃ sa dharma iti niścayaḥ}\thinspace ||
 
  
 
  Note the similarities of the above passage from the \MBH\ with this present \VSS\ chapter:
  the phrase \textit{dharma ity āhur},
  the fact that the present chapter from verse 18 on is actually a chapter on \textit{ahiṃsā},
  and that the etymological explanation involves the word [\textit{ā}]\textit{dhāraṇa} in
  both cases. These have led me to think that in \textit{pāda}s ab of the verse in the \VSS\
  it is Dharma that is the focus of the inquiry, as in the \MBH, and not the bull.
 
  
 Understand \textit{pāda} d as \textit{gatayas tasya kati smṛtāḥ}. I have accepted
  \textit{smṛtāḥ} because this plural at the end of the phrase
  signals that \textit{gatis} is meant to be plural,
  similarly to what happens in 3.6cd {\rm (}\textit{tasya patnī... mahābhāgāḥ}{\rm )}.
  On this, see p.~\pageref{number} in the Introduction.
  On Dharma as a bull, see Introduction, pp.~\pageref{bull}.

  The insertion `[of] the [same]' in my translation solves the problem of a noun {\rm (}\textit{dhṛti}{\rm )} seemingly

  On the more frequently quoted interpretation of the four legs, see

  `Dharma and truth possess all four feet and are whole during the Kṛta yuga, 
  and people did not obtain anything unrighteously {\rm (}\textit{adharmeṇa}{\rm )}. 
  By obtaining, however, \textit{dharma} has lost one foot during each of the other \textit{yuga}s 
  and righteousness {\rm (}\textit{dharma}{\rm )} likewise has diminished by one quarter due to theft, 
  falsehood, and deceit.'
  
 
  Understand \textit{pāda}s c and d as \textit{catvāri āśramāṇi kīrtitāni dharmo manīṣibhiḥ} or
  \textit{yo dharmaḥ kīrtitaś caturāśramāṇi manīṣibhiḥ} or

  \textit{prasūtisambhavāḥ} in \textit{pāda} d is a rather bold conjecture that can be supported by two facts:
  firstly, the readings of the manuscripts are difficult to make sense of and thus are
  probably corrupt; secondly, a corruption from the name Prasūti,
  traditionally the name of Dakṣa's wife, to \textit{ābhūti}
  is relatively easily to explain, \textit{sū} and \textit{bhū} being close enough in some scripts 
  {\rm (}e.g. in \msCa{\rm )} to cause confusion. Another option would be to accept 
  Ābhūti as the name of Dakṣa's wife.
  
 
  For Prasūti being Dakṣa's wife in other sources,

  \textit{nāgnir dadāha romāpi satyena jagataḥ spaśaḥ}\thinspace ||
  
 
  Olivelle's translation {\rm (}\citeyear{OlivelleManu}, 311{\rm )}: 
  `Long ago when Vatsa was accused by his younger brother, 
  Fire, the world's spy, did not burn a single hair of his because he told the truth.'
  Olivelle's note on this verse {\rm (}ibid. 311{\rm )} reads:
  `Vatsa was accused by his brother of being the son of a Śūdra woman and thus not 
  a pure Brahmin. Vatsa went through fire to prove his pedigree. See \textit{Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa}
  14.6.6.'
 
  Since \textit{śaśi} {\rm (}instead of \textit{śaśin}{\rm )} is a possible stem in this text, 
  \textit{śaśir ācaraḥ} {\rm (}\msNa\msNb\msNc{\rm )} in \textit{pāda} b could be acceptable here,
  perhaps standing metri causa for the compound \textit{śaśicaraḥ}.
  Nevertheless, I have chosen to conjecture \textit{śaśinaś caraḥ}, now preferring it
  to my previous conjecture, \textit{śaśinā caraḥ}.
  Other possibilities, suggested by Judit Törzsök and other colleagues, include \textit{śaśibhāskaraḥ}, 
  \textit{śaśigocaraḥ}, \textit{śiśiro 'caraḥ}, and \textit{śiśirāmbhasaḥ}. Similar passages quoted in the apparatus
  suggest that the Moon vaxes, or shines, by truth {\rm (}\textit{satyena vardhate}/\textit{rājate}{\rm )}.
  Compare also a passage in the \MBH\ {\rm (}quoted in the apparatus{\rm )} that 
  compares Hariścandra, renowned for his truthfulness, to the Moon, 
  using the verb \textit{carati}. These passages seem to support a reading close to
  my conjecture.
 
 
 
  While it is not clear if \textit{pāda}s ab refer to specific legends or not,
  \textit{pāda}s cd hint at the story of Agastya and the Vindhya mountain {\rm (}as pointed out to me
  by Judit Törzsök{\rm )}:
  Vindhya became jealous of the Sun's revolving around Mount Meru, and when the Sun 
  refused him the same favour, he decided to grow higher and obstruct the Sun's movement.
  As a solution to this situation, Agastya asked Vidhya to bend down to make 
  it easier for him to reach the south and to remain thus until he retured. 
  Vindhya agreed to do what Agastya asked him but Agastya never returned. 
  See \MBH\ 3.102.1--14 {\rm (}see the word \textit{samaya} in verse 13 in this passage, and compare it to \VSS\ 4.12b{\rm )}:

  This is still problematic because both human and

  For Śiva of eight forms, see, e.g., \textit{Śakuntalā} 1.1:
  
 
  [1] \textit{yā sṛṣṭiḥ sraṣṭur ādyā vahati} [2] \textit{vidhihutaṃ yā havir} [3] \textit{yā ca hotrī}
 
  [4, 5] \textit{ye dve kālaṃ vidhattaḥ} [6] \textit{śruti-viṣaya-guṇā yā sthitā vyāpya viśvam}\thinspace |
 
  [7] \textit{yām āhuḥ sarva-bīja-prakṛtir iti yayā prāṇinaḥ prāṇavantaḥ} [8]
 
  \textit{pratyakṣābhiḥ prapannas tanubhir avatu vas tābhir aṣṭābhir īśaḥ}\thinspace ||
  
 
  Here the eight \textit{mūrti}s, or rather, \textit{tanu}s, are: 
  [1] \textit{jala}, [2] \textit{agni}, [3] \textit{hotrī} {\rm (}`the form that sacrifices'{\rm )}, [4 + 5] \textit{sūrya} + \textit{candra},
  [6] \textit{ākāśa}, [7] \textit{bhūmi}, [8] \textit{vāyu}.
 
  For a similar interpretation of \textit{aṣṭamūrti}, see, e.g., 
  \Isanasiva\ 2.29.34 {\rm (}\textit{mantrapāda}; note \textit{yajamāna} for our \textit{dīkṣa}{\rm )}:
  
 
  \textit{kṣmā-vahni-yajamānārka-jala-vāyv-indu-puṣkaraiḥ}\thinspace |
 
  \textit{aṣṭābhir mūrtibhiḥ śambhor dvitīyāvaraṇaṃ smṛtam}\thinspace ||
  
 
  {\rm (}For \textit{puṣkara} as `sky, atmosphere', see, e.g., \Amara\ 1.2.167:
  \textit{dyodivau dve striyām abhraṃ vyoma puṣkaram ambaram}.{\rm )}
 
  A closely related Aṣṭamūrti-hymn appears in \Nisvmukh\ 1.30--41 {\rm (}I owe thanks to Nirajan Kafle
  for drawing my attention to this{\rm )}; see \mycitep{KafleNisvasaBook}{62, 63, 116, 119}. 
  Kafle notes that this hymn is closely parallel to some passages in the \textit{Prayogamañjarī} {\rm (}1.19--26{\rm )},
  the \textit{Tantrasamuccaya} {\rm (}1.16--23{\rm )}, and the \textit{Īśānaśivagurudevapaddhati} {\rm (}\textit{kriyāpāda} 26.56--63{\rm )}.

  For Daṇḍa{\rm (}ka{\rm )}'s story, see \RAMAYANA\ 7.71.31 ff.:
  Daṇḍa meets Arajā, a beautiful girl, in a forest and rapes her. As a consequence, 
  her father, Śukra/Bhārgava, destroys Daṇḍa's kingdom, which thus
  becomes the desolate Daṇḍaka-forest.
 
  
 
  For two versions of the destruction of
  Sagara's sons {\rm (}note emendation in \textit{pāda} c{\rm )}, 
  who were chasing the sacrificial horse of their father's Aśvamedha sacrifice,

  As for Rāvaṇa's haughtiness,
  especially the fact that he chose to be invincible by all creatures except humans,
  and its consequences,
  one should recall the story of the \RAMAYANA\ and Rāvaṇa's destruction brought about by Rāma therein.

  Saudāsa had to roam the world as a Rākṣasa for twelve years. 
  See \MBH\ 1.166.1ff.
 
  
 
  As for the end of the Yādavas, see the short \textit{Mausalaparvan} of the \MBH\ {\rm (}canto 16{\rm )}:
  cursed by the sages Viśvāmitra, Kaṇva and Nārada, and seeing menacing omens,
  the Yādavas take to drinking in Prabhāsa and destroy each other.
 
 Most probably, \textit{atitṛṣṇā} in the MSS stands for \textit{atitṛṣṇāt} {\rm (}intending \textit{atitṛṣṇayā}{\rm )},
  and the forms \textit{māndhāto}/\textit{mandhāto} in \msCb\ stand for \textit{māndhātā} {\rm (}nominative of \textit{māndhātṛ}{\rm )}.
  I have corrected these in spite of the fact that the authors' knowledge about Māndhātṛ's story may
  come from \DIVYAV\ 17, where it sometimes appears to be an a-stem noun {\rm (}\textit{māndhāta}{\rm )}.
  \textit{dvijavajñayā} in \textit{pāda} d stands for \textit{dvijāvajñayā} metri causa.
 
  
 
  Māndhātṛ was born from his father's body who, being excessively thirsty once,
  had drank some decoction prepared for ritual purposes and as a result become pregnant with him.
  Nevertheless, \BUDDHACARITA\ 11.13 suggests that Māndhātṛ himself was still unsatisfied
  with wordly objects even after he had obtained half of Indra's throne:
  
 
  \textit{devena vṛṣṭe 'pi hiraṇyavarṣe} 
  \textit{dvīpān samagrāṃś caturo 'pi jitvā}\thinspace | 
  
  \textit{śakrasya cārdhāsanam apy avāpya}
  \textit{māndhātur āsīd viṣayeṣv atṛptiḥ}\thinspace ||
  
 
  In Johnston's translation {\rm (}\citeyear{Buddhacarita}, II. 151{\rm )}:
  
 
  `Though the heavens rained gold for him and though he conquered the whole
  of the four continents and won half the seat of Śakra, yet Māndhātṛ's longing
  for the objects of sense remained unappeased.'
  
 
  In fact, as Monika Zin points out {\rm (}\mycitep{ZinMandhatar}{149}{\rm )},
  Māndhātṛ/Māndhāta's rise and fall is a very popular theme
  in the `Narrative Art of the Amaravati School': 
  `Statistics show that in the Amaravati School the most frequently represented narrative is
  the story of King Māndhātar, which appears 47 times.'
  
  
 
  Nahuṣa was elevated to the position of Indra for a period of time and he also wanted
  to take Śacī, Indra's wife. Indra instructed Śacī to tell Nahuṣa to 
  harness some Ṛsis to a vehicle and use this vehicle to take Śacī. 
  Agastya, one of the Ṛṣis, was insulted even further by Nahuṣa, therefore
  he cursed Nahuṣa, who then fell from the vehicle. See \MBH\ 12.329.35ff and
  a verse in the \BUDDHACARITA\ {\rm (}11.14{\rm )} that follows the one about Māndhātṛ:
  
 
  \textit{bhuktvāpi rājyaṃ divi devatānāṃ} 
  \textit{śatakratau vṛtrabhayāt pranaṣṭe}\thinspace | 
 
  \textit{darpān maharṣīn api vāhayitvā} 
  \textit{kāmeṣv atṛpto nahuṣaḥ papāta}\thinspace ||
  
 
  In Johnston's translation {\rm (}\citeyear{Buddhacarita}, II. 151{\rm )}:
  
 
  `Although he enjoyed sovereignty over the gods in heaven, when Śatakratu hid himself
  for fear of Vṛtra, and though out of wanton pride he made the great ṛṣis carry him,
  yet Nahuṣa fell, being still unsatisfied with the passions.'

  sense of the sentence. We are lacking a verb; \textit{āhāra} might be wrong for \textit{āharet} {\rm (}see \msM{\rm )}.
  The Āyurvedic implications of this clumsy verse are not crystal clear to me.
  What is clear is that traditionally there are
  six basic flavours or `juices' in food. See, e.g. \BHELAS\ 1.28.1:
  
 
  \textit{yad bhakṣayati bhuṅkte vā vidhivac cāpi mānavaḥ}\thinspace |
 
  \textit{anyac ca kiñcit pibati tat sarvaṃ ṣaḍrasānvitam}\thinspace ||
  
 
  `All that a human eats or enjoys according to the rules, and furthermore all 
  that he or she drinks, is endowed with the six flavours.'
  
 
  To repair \textit{pāda}s ab, one should perhaps imagine that the intended meaning was that the
  six flavours/juices should be present in a harmonious proportion in a wise man's food. 
  Cf. \BHELAS\ 3.1.1:
  
 
  \textit{śarīraṃ dhārayantīha ṣaḍrasāḥ samam āhṛtāḥ}\thinspace |
 
  \textit{ato 'nyathā vikārāṃs tu janayanti śarīriṇām}\thinspace ||
  
 
  `The six flavours will support the body in this world when brought to a balanced state.
  Otherwise they will produce defects to people.'
 On \textit{dhātuvaiṣamya}, the balanced state of the bodily constituents \textit{pitta}, 
  \textit{kapha} and \textit{vāyu}, see, e.g., \CARAKA\ 1.9.4:
  
 
  \textit{vikāro dhātuvaiṣamyaṃ sāmyaṃ prakṛtir ucyate}\thinspace | 
 
  \textit{sukhasaṃjñakam ārogyaṃ vikāro duḥkham eva ca}\thinspace ||

  There are several possible interpretations for \textit{pāda}s d and e.
  \textit{śivasaṃhitam} could mean `Śaiva texts and the [Bhārata]saṃhitā,'
  i.e. the \MBh;
  see 5.17b above: \textit{śaivabhāratasaṃhite}. Alternatively, it
  may mean `the collection of Śaiva teachings.'
  As for \textit{itihāsapurāṇaṃ}, it is most probably a dvandva compound, most probably
  denoting the \MBh\ {\rm (}but perhaps not the 
  \Ramayana, contrary to claims such as that, e.g., in 
  \mycitep{SocialLiteraryHistoryDharma}{34, n.~6}{\rm )},
  and the Purāṇas. In case \textit{saṃhitam} in \textit{pāda} d means the \MBh,
  \textit{itihāsapurāṇaṃ} could in general mean `histories and legends.'
  In the light of 8.1--6, where \textit{itihāsa} clearly means the \MBh,
  and Purāṇas are mentioned separately, this is unlikely. 
  In my translation, I have left these terms untranslated.
  For the debate on what \textit{itihāsa} is, see, e.g., \mycite{ReadingFifthVeda} and
  \mycite{BaileyPuranas}. 
  
  Both \textit{śivasaṃhitam} and \textit{itihāsapurāṇaṃ} should be interpreted as
  being part of the compound in \textit{pāda} c: \textit{śiva\-saṃhitādhyayanaṃ} and 
  \textit{itihāsapurāṇādhyayanaṃ}. 
 
  See \textit{japayajña} mentioned, e.g., in \BHG\ 10.25c {\rm (}\textit{yajñānāṃ japayajño 'smi}{\rm )}

  that of Dadhīca, who gave his bones to Indra to help him defeat Vṛtra.

  a specific legend. The perfect form \textit{bubhuje}, and the next \textit{pāda}, at least point to this direction.
 My translation of \textit{pāda} d is also tentative. I take \textit{surūpayonisubhaga} as
  \textit{surūpa-suyoni-subhaga}. Unfortunately, the reference to any specific legend
  escapes me. Perhaps the reference is to Brahmā's boon to Tārakāsura,
  which ultimately was the cause of Skanda's birth.

  perhaps understand \textit{dhunanaṃ} {\rm (}related to \textit{dhvanana}{\rm )}, 
  or emend to \textit{dhvananaṃ}.
 A possible expanation for Śiva being satisfied with an ascetic practising 
  this observance is that Śiva's Bhairava form often has a dog as his mount. See, e.g.,
  \mycitep{BakkerWorld2014}{232--233} on a 5-6th-century 
  image of Bhairava and a dog carved in rock at Muṇḍeśvarī Hill not far from Vārāṇasī.
  
 
  The so-called dog observance has ancient roots. Its practitioner, the \textit{kukkuravatika}
  appears in \textit{Majjhimanikāya} 2.1.7, in the \textit{Kukkuravatiyasutta}, 
  alongside with a practitioner of the \textit{govrata} {\rm (}\textit{govatika}{\rm )}, an observance
  that comes up in the next verse in the \VSS:
  \textit{evaṃ me sutaṃ. ekaṃ samayaṃ bhagavā koliyesu viharati haliddavasanaṃ nāma koliyānaṃ nigamo.}
  \textit{atha kho puṇṇo ca koliyaputto govatiko, acelo ca seniyo kukkuravatiko yena}
  \textit{bhagavā tenupasaṅkamiṃsu...}
  See \mycitep{AcharyaBull}{127--128}. Acharya 
  summarises the \textit{Kukkuravatiyasutta} thus:
  `The \textit{Kukkuravatiyasutta} from the \textit{Majjhimanikāya} {\rm (}II.1.7{\rm )} 
  presents a \textit{govatika} together with a \textit{kukkuravatika}. They are observing 
  their vows, and have adopted the behaviour of a bull and a dog respectively. 
  The Buddha tells them that as they are cultivating bullness and dogness, 
  the state of mind of these animals, they will go to hell or become reborn as animal.
  They are alarmed at this and take refuge in the Buddha.'

  one either in stem form {\rm (}\msCa\msCb\msNa\msNc\msParis{\rm )} or as \textit{bhīmas} {\rm (}\msCc\msNb\Ed{\rm )}
  or \textit{bhīmaṃ} {\rm (}\eme{\rm )}, to reading these two words as a compound because
  of the following \textit{caiva}.
  I suspect that both \textit{bhīma} and \textit{tuṣṭikara} refer to the \textit{vrata}, rather than its practitioner,
  but I have not emended \textit{bhīmas tuṣṭikaraś} to \textit{bhīmaṃ tuṣṭikaraṃ}
  because \textit{vrata} appears as a masculine noun, e.g., in 8.17d below.
 
  Acharya {\rm (}\citeyear{AcharyaBull}, 116--118{\rm )} gives a number of significant clues about the origins 
  of this observance. After exploring its links to Pāśupatas, 
  he quotes \textit{Jaiminīyabrāhmaṇa} 2.113, which contains the phrase 
  \textit{yatra yatrainaṃ viṣṭhā vindet tat tad vitiṣṭheta}, in Acharya's translation:
  `Wherever he feels the urge to evacuate f\ae ces, right there he should evacuate.'
  This is an instruction in a Vedic text that is close to what the \VSS\ teaches above.
  Incidentaly, the \textit{Jaiminīyabrāhmaṇa} adds:
  \textit{tena haitenottaravayasy e}[\textit{va}] \textit{yajeta}

  `One should perform this [sacrifice] in the ﬁnal years of one's life'{\rm )}.

\translation{Splitting [the earth] with spades and laid out on hundreds of pointed wedges: Goddess Earth bears [this] patiently. This is exactly how one can practise the earth vow. \blankfootnote{8.17 While \textit{dārayanto} as an active participle in the masculine nominative is acceptable
  as an irregular form, the precise interpretation of \textit{pāda}s a and b is still problematic,
  therefore my translation of this verse is tentative and the description seems too condensed to be
  intelligible. Kengo Harimoto suggested that \msCc\ and \Ed\ might be transmitting
  the correct reading, and then the reference would be to soil 
  piled up by millions of insects {\rm (}\textit{kīṭakoṭi}°{\rm )}, instead of points of
  wedges {\rm (}\textit{kīlakoṭi}°{\rm )}. Nevertheless, now I think that the reference point could
  be Bhīṣma's dying scene in the \MBH, where the great warrior is lying on a bed of hundreds of arrows: 
  \textit{sa śete śaratalpastho medinīm aspṛśaṃs tadā}: `Then he lay there on his bed of arrows,
  without touching the ground' {\rm (}\MBH\ 6.115.8ab{\rm )}. The word \textit{cita} is used in the same context in 
  \MBH\ 12.47.4ab: \textit{vikīrṇāṃśur ivādityo bhīṣmaḥ śaraśataiś citaḥ}: 
  `Bhīṣma, laid on a hundred arrows, was like the Sun with its scattered rays of light.'
  If this interpretation of \VSS\ 8.17 is correct, the observance described here may require
  one to dig the ground, install wedges, and lie on them, in the manner of fakirs.
  The reference to the Earth in \textit{pāda} c may have been inspired by lines such as \MBH\
  6.115.11cd: \textit{rarāsa pṛthivī caiva bhīṣme śāṃtanave hate}:
  `The Earth cried out when Bhīṣma, the son of Śaṃtanu, was killed.'
 
  In \BHAVP\ 4.121, called `The Description of eighty-five observances' {\rm (}\textit{vratapañcāśītivarṇana}{\rm )},
  we find this on \textit{mahīvrata}:
  
 
  \textit{dadyāt triṃśatpalād ūrdhvaṃ mahīṃ kṛtvā tu kāṃcanīm}\thinspace |
 
  \textit{kulācalādrisahitāṃ tilavastrasamanvitām}\thinspace || 152\thinspace ||

  \textit{etan mahīvrataṃ proktaṃ saptakalpānuvartakam}\thinspace |
 
  
 
  A tentative translation of this passage would go as follows: `One should donate a golden [model of] Earth
  that weighs more than thirty \textit{pala}s {\rm (}appr. one kilogram{\rm )}, showing the chief mountain-ranges,
  together with [donations of] sesamum seeds and clothes, the sesamum seeds [weighing] more than
  a \textit{droṇa} {\rm (}appr. ten kilograms{\rm )}, to a householder Brāhmin. One should keep the milk-observance 
  [i.e. subsisting on nothing but milk] for one day, and one will have fun in Rudraloka.
  This is called the Earth Observance whose range is seven \ae ons.' {\rm (}I take the values for weights
  from \mycitep{OlivelleManu}{997}.{\rm )} \MATSP\ 101.52 gives similar instructions, 
  as do the descriptions of the \textit{dharāvrata} and the \textit{śubhadvādaśī} observances in 
  \mycitep{KaneHistory}{v. 5, 321 and 429}.
  The \VSS's \textit{mahīvrata} seems different, and more in line with 
  the somewhat transgressive and wild, perhaps Pāśupata-oriented, nature of the
  four preceding observances.
