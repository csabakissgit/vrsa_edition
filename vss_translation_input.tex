  \Ed's silent emendation to \textit{samprabodhayet} is understandable since to `enter' these realms

\translation{[He does] not [bury] his urine and f\ae ces in the ground, and he barks constantly. Lord Śarva [i.e. Śiva] is satisfied when one practises the dog observance. \blankfootnote{8.15 \textit{dhunadaṃ} {\rm (}`barking'?{\rm )} in \textit{pāda} b may not be the intended form;
  perhaps understand \textit{dhunanaṃ} {\rm (}related to \textit{dhvanana}{\rm )}, 
  or emend to \textit{dhvananaṃ}.
 A possible expanation for Śiva being satisfied with an ascetic practising 
  this observance is that Śiva's Bhairava form often has a dog as his mount. See, e.g.,
  \mycitep{BakkerWorld2014}{232--233} on a 5-6th-century 
  image of Bhairava and a dog carved in rock at Muṇḍeśvarī Hill not far from Vārāṇasī, 
  and Mirnig 2013, 334 ?\verify 
  This observance has ancient roots. Its practitioner, the \textit{kukkuravatika}
  appears in \textit{Majjhimanikāya} 2.1.7, in the \textit{Kukkuravatiyasutta}, 
  alongside with a practitioner of the \textit{govrata} {\rm (}\textit{govatika}{\rm )}, an observance
  that comes up in the next verse in the \VSS:
  \textit{evaṃ me sutaṃ. ekaṃ samayaṃ bhagavā koliyesu viharati haliddavasanaṃ nāma koliyānaṃ nigamo.
  atha kho puṇṇo ca koliyaputto govatiko, acelo ca seniyo kukkuravatiko yena 
  bhagavā tenupasaṅkamiṃsu...}
  See \mycitep{AcharyaBull}{127--128}. Acharya 
  summarises the \textit{Kukkuravatiyasutta} thus:
  `The \textit{Kukkuravatiyasutta} from the \textit{Majjhimanikāya} {\rm (}II.1.7{\rm )} 
  presents a \textit{govatika} together with a \textit{kukkuravatika}. They are observing 
  their vows, and have adopted the behaviour of a bull and a dog respectively. 
  The Buddha tells them that as they are cultivating bullness and dogness, 
  the state of mind of these animals, they will go to hell or become reborn as animal.
  They are alarmed at this and take refuge in the Buddha.'

\translation{A person practising the Cow Observance should never hold back his urine and f\ae ces. This is a terrifying [observance] that gives satisfaction, [as] stated in the Purāṇas. \blankfootnote{8.16 I prefer reading \textit{bhīma} and \textit{tuṣṭi°} as two separate words, the first
  one either in stem form {\rm (}\msCa\msCb\msNa\msNc\msParis{\rm )} or as \textit{bhīmas} {\rm (}\msCc\msNb\Ed{\rm )}
  or \textit{bhīmaṃ} {\rm (}\eme{\rm )}, to reading these two words as a compound because
  of the following \textit{caiva}.
  I suspect that both \textit{bhīma} and \textit{tuṣṭikara} refer to the \textit{vrata}, rather than its practitioner,
  but I have not emended \textit{bhīmas tuṣṭikaraś} to \textit{bhīmaṃ tuṣṭikaraṃ}
  because \textit{vrata} appears as a masculine noun, e.g., in 8.17d below.
 
  \mycite{AcharyaBull} gives a number of significant clues about the origins 
  of this observance. After exploring its links to Pāśupatas, 
  \mycitep{AcharyaBull}{116--118},
  quotes \textit{Jaiminīyabrāhmaṇa} 2.113, which contains the phrase 
  \textit{yatra yatrainaṃ viṣṭhā vindet tat tad vitiṣṭheta}, in Acharya's translation:
  `Wherever he feels the urge to evacuate f\ae ces, right there he should evacuate.'
  This is an instruction in a Vedic text that is close to what the \VSS\ teaches above.
  Incidentaly, the \textit{Jaiminīyabrāhmaṇa} adds:
  \textit{tena haitenottaravayasy e} [\textit{va}] \textit{yajeta}
  {\rm (}translated in \mycitep{AcharyaBull}{118} as: 
  `One should perform this [sacrifice] in the ﬁnal years of one's life'{\rm )}.

\translation{Splitting [the earth] with spades and laid out on hundreds of pointed wedges: Goddess Earth bears [this] patiently. This is exactly how one can practise the earth vow. \blankfootnote{8.17 While \textit{dārayanto} as an active participle in the masculine nominative is acceptable
  as an irregular form, the precise interpretation of \textit{pāda}s a and b is still problematic,
  therefore my translation of this verse is tentative and the description seems too condensed to be
  intelligible. Kengo Harimoto suggested that \msCc\ and \Ed\ might be transmitting
  the correct reading, and then the reference would be to soil 
  piled up by millions of insects {\rm (}\textit{kīṭakoṭi}°{\rm )}, instead of points of
  wedges {\rm (}\textit{kīlakoṭi}°{\rm )}. Nevertheless, now I think that the reference point could
  be Bhīṣma's dying scene in the \MBH, where the great warrior is lying on a bed of hundreds of arrows: 
  \textit{sa śete śaratalpastho medinīm aspṛśaṃs tadā}: `Then he lay there on his bed of arrows,
  without touching the ground' {\rm (}\MBH\ 6.115.8ab{\rm )}. The word \textit{cita} is used in the same context in 
  \MBH\ 12.47.4ab: \textit{vikīrṇāṃśur ivādityo bhīṣmaḥ śaraśataiś citaḥ}: 
  `Bhīṣma, laid on a hundred arrows, was like the Sun with its scattered rays of light.'
  If this interpretation of \VSS\ 8.17 is correct, the observance described here may require
  one to dig the ground, install wedges, and lie on them, in the manner of fakirs.
  The reference to the Earth in \textit{pāda} c may have been inspired by lines such as \MBH\
  6.115.11cd: \textit{rarāsa pṛthivī caiva bhīṣme śāṃtanave hate}:
  `The Earth cried out when Bhīṣma, the son of Śaṃtanu, was killed.'
 
  In \BHAVP\ 4.121, called `The Description of eighty-five observances' {\rm (}\textit{vratapañcāśītivarṇana}{\rm )},
  we find this on \textit{mahīvrata}:
  \textit{dadyāt triṃśatpalād ūrdhvaṃ mahīṃ kṛtvā tu kāṃcanīm\thinspace |
  kulācalādrisahitāṃ tilavastrasamanvitām\thinspace || 152\thinspace || 
  tiladroṇopari gatāṃ brāhmaṇāya kuṭuṃbine\thinspace | 
  dinaṃ payovratas tiṣṭhed rudraloke mahīyate\thinspace || 153\thinspace || 
  etan mahīvrataṃ proktaṃ saptakalpānuvartakam\thinspace |}.
 
  A tentative translation of this passage would go as follows: `One should donate a golden [model of] Earth
  that weighs more than thirty \textit{pala}s {\rm (}appr. one kilogram{\rm )}, showing the chief mountain-ranges,
  together with [donations of] sesamum seeds and clothes, the sesamum seeds [weighing] more than
  a \textit{droṇa} {\rm (}appr. ten kilograms{\rm )}, to a householder Brāhmin. One should keep the milk-observance 
  [i.e. subsisting on nothing but milk] for one day, and one will have fun in Rudraloka.
  This is called the Earth Observance whose range is seven \ae ons.' {\rm (}I take the values for weights
  from \mycitep{OlivelleManu}{997}.{\rm )} \MATSP\ 101.52 gives similar instructions, 
  as are the descriptions of the \textit{dharāvrata} and the \textit{śubhadvādaśī} observance in 
  \mycitep{KaneHistory}{v. 5, 321 and 429}.
  The \VSS's \textit{mahīvrata} seems different, and more in line with 
  the somewhat transgressive and wild, perhaps Pāśupata-oriented, nature of the
  four preceding observances.
