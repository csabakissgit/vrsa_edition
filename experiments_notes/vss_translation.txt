1.1 The Compendium on the Essence of the Dharma Bull
Chapter One
Having bowed to [Him] who has no beginning, middle part and end,
whose boundaries are limitless, who is very subtle and who
is the unmanifest and fine essence of the world,
who is ... [to be worshipped?] by Hari, Indra, Brahmā and the other [gods],
I shall teach the Compendium on the Essence of the Bull.

1.2 Having listened to the Bhāratasaṃhitā, the supreme book of 100,000 [verses], 1,000 chapters
and a hundred sections, in its entirety,

1.3 Janamejaya remained unsatisfied and what he asked Vaiśampāyana
in the past, listen to that unwearied.

1.4 Janamejaya spoke:
O venerable sir, O knower of the entire Dharma, O you who are well-versed in all the Śāstras!
Is there a supreme and secret Dharma which liberates [us] from the ocean of Saṃsāra?

1.5 Tell me the Dharma that was uttered by Dvaipāyana, O best of Brahmins.
Help me find satisfaction at all cost, O great ascetic!

1.6 Vaiśampāyana spoke:
Listen with great attention, O king, to this unsurpassed narration of Dharma.
Hear the secret Dharma that I received by Vyāsa's favour.

1.7 Viṣṇu, the great Lord, assumed the form of a Brahmin and
to test him he humbly asked the one who performed immaterial sacrifices
[i.e. Anarthayajña] a question, [Anarthayajña,] the one who was focused
in his austerities and observances,
and whose conduct was virtuous and pure, and who was intent on
compassion towards all living beings.

1.9 [Vigatarāga spoke:]
How is the knowledge of Brahman to be known if it is devoid of form and colour?
What[?] is the supreme[?] syllable which is devoid of vowels and consonants?

1.10 Anarthayajña spoke:
That supreme[?] syllable is not to be pronounced, is unquestionable, non-dividable, consistent,
spotless, all-pervading and subtle.

1.11 Vigatarāga spoke:
When the body disintegrates in the ground, in water, in fire or [is torn apart] by jackals,
how is the supportless and spotless soul led [to the other world] by Yama's messengers?

1.12 How is it bound by the noose of time? And if it is bodiless, how can it move?
And how does the [soul of a] virtuous [person]
reach heaven if it has no body?
These are my doubts, teach me! I want to know the truth.

1.13 Anarthyajña spoke:
Your doubts that you put to me are extremely problematic, O great Brahmin.
It is difficult to understand by humans, and [even] by Devas, Dānavas and Serpents.

1.14 Anarthayajña spoke:
The cause of both the birth and death of the body is karma.
Good and bad deeds are called the two nooses.

1.15 [Man] goes to hell or heaven accordingly.
Happiness and suffering, both arising from karma, are to be experienced by the body.

1.16 O great Brahmin, the body is produced for humans for his reason.
Now hear that which they call the noose of time, I shall teach you, O you of great observances.

1.17 You don't know anything. How could you start your investigation [in this way], O Brahmin?
O Brahmin king, you should know the noose of time in its entirety.

1.18 Learn about time which is divided by digits and about the art of the truth of time.
Two atomic spaces of time (truṭi) is one twinkling (nimeṣa).
One digit [kalā] is twice a twinkling.

1.19 Two digits is one Kāṣṭhā.?? One Kāṣṭhā is 30 digits.??
30 Kalās make up one Muhūrta according to mankind, O great Brahmin.

1.20 30 Muhūrtas are known to the wise as night and day [i.e. a full day].
Thirty days and nights are taught by the wise ones to be one month.

1.21 One year is twelve months, [say] those who know the truth about time.
Three hundred thousand years[?] are ... ?

1.22 The Kali era is said to be the time [span] of sixty thousand [years].
The Dvāpara era is known to be twice [as long as] the Kali era.

1.23 The Tretā era is thrice [as long], the Kṛta era four times [as long as the Kali].
The number related to the four Yugas is seventy-one:

1.24 [thus] the knowledge about one Manvantara is being taught briefly
[i.e. 71 four-fold Mahāyugas is a Manvantara].
One Kalpa is fourteen Manvantaras.

1.25 Ten thousand Kalpas is Brahmā's day.
[His] night is of the same [length] according to the wise who know the truth.

1.26 When the night falls they dissolve, the whole moving and unmoving universe.
And when daylight comes, the moving and unmoving [universe] is born.

1.27 The past is para times parārdha [number of] kalpas [i.e. a hundred million billions (parārdha) times
two million billions (para)], O great Brahmin.
Bhṛgu and the other sages say that the future is the same [time span].

1.28 Just as the sun, the planets, the stars[?] and the moon are seen as wandering around
in this world,
the wheel of time spins around and we never stop. ????

1.29 Time creates living beings and time destroys them again.
Everything is under the control of time. There is nothing that can bring time under control.

1.30 Fourteen parārdha are the kings[?], O Brahmin,
have been passed by time, for time is difficult to overcome.

1.31 This is time as a great yogin, as Brahmā, Viṣṇu and supreme Śiva,
beginningless and endless, the creator, the great soul. Pay homage [to Time].

1.32 [The Parārdha etc.: divisions of time]
Vigatarāga spoke:
I have just heard [the term] `wheel of time' uttered from [your] lotus mouth,
as well as `parārdha' and `para'. ....?

1.33 Anarthayajña spoke:
One, ten, a hundred, a thousand, and ten thousand,
a hundred thousand[?] (prayuta), a million (niyuta), ten millions (koṭi),
a hundred millions (arbuda), and a billion (vṛnda),

1.34 10 billions (kharva), 100 billions (nikharva), 1000 billions (śaṅku), and
ten thousand billions (padma),
100 thousand billions (samudra), a million billions (madhya),  ten million billions (anta),
a hundred million billions (parārdha), and two million billions (para).

1.35 All should be known as powers of ten up to Parārdha.
The number corresponding to para is double the parārdha.

1.36 There is no higher number than para. This is my conviction
based on readings of the Purāṇas and the Vedas and [now] taught [to you], O great Brahmin.

1.37 Vigatarāga spoke:
How many eggs of Brahmā are there, and is its measure taught anywhere?
... ? the sun heats the earth.

1.38 How could I enumerate all the eggs of Brahmā[?], O Brahmin?
Even the gods don't know them [all], not to mention mortals.

1.39 I shall teach [them to you] one by one, as far as I can, O great Brahmin,
[that] which Brahmā taught in the past [to?] Mātariśvan, as it really is.

1.40 Inside Śiva's egg.....
The ten names [of cosmic rulers/worlds] associated with each of the
ten directions in Brahmā's egg are being taught now, listen.

1.41 ***[The ten names [of cosmic rulers/worlds] associated with each of the ten directions]***
[1] Saha, [2] Asaha, [3] Sahas, [4] Sahya, [5] Visaha, [6] Saṃhata, [7] Sabhā,
[8] Prasaha, [9] Aprasaha, [10] Sānu: [these are] the ten Leaders in the East.

1.52 Each of the ten deities[?] has a retinue of a hundred times hundred [deities].
Each one in [these groups of] a hundred is surrounded by a thousand.

1.53 Each one in these [groups of] thousands is surrounded by ten thousand,
by a hundred thousand, a million, a billion..... .

1.54 Each one has a retinue of a Niyuta [members].

1.60 Here about the measurments [of the universe] briefly, O Brahmin, from me,
I shall teach [you].
The Vedic redactors [of the Purāṇas]

1.64 O true Brahmin, the 80,000,000 [?] Purāṇas
were taught by [1] Brahmā to [2] Mātariśvan [= Vāyu] in their entirety, as they were.

1.65 Vāyu abridged the verses and then gave [the Purāṇas] to [3] Uśanas.
He [Uśanas] also abridged the verses, and [4] Bṛhaspati received them.

1.66 Bṛhaspati taught 30,000 [verses] to [5] Sūrya [the Sun].
Divākara [= the Sun] taught 25,000 [verses] to [6] Mṛtyu [Death].

1.67 Death taught 21,000 [verses] to [7] Indra.
Indra taught 20,000 verses to [8] Vasiṣṭha.

1.68 And he[, Vasiṣṭha taught] 18,000 [verses] to [9] Sārasvata.
Sārasvatas [taught] 17,000 [verses] to [10] Tridhāman.

1.69 [Tridhāman] taught 16,000 verses to [11] Bharadvāja.
[Bharadvāja] taught 15,000 verses to [12] Trivṛṣa.

1.70 [Trivṛṣa] then [taught] 14,000 verses to [13] Antarīkṣa.
[Antarīkṣa] taught 13,000 [verses] to [14] Trayyāruṇi.

1.71 Trayyāruṇi, the great Brahmin, having abridged them again,
taught 12,000 [verses] to [15] Dhanaṃjaya.

1.72 Dhanaṃjaya, the great sage, handed [them] over to [16] Kṛtaṃjaya.
[It was transmitted] from Kṛtaṃjaya, O great Brahmin, to [17] noble Ṛṇaṃjaya.

1.73 Then from Ṛṇaṃjaya it was given to [18] Gautama, the great sage,
from Gautama to [19??] Bharadvāja[?], from him to [19/20] Dharmadvata.

1.74 Then [20/21] Rājaśravas received it, then [21/22] Somaśuṣma.
Then from Somaśuṣma, [22/23] Tṛṇabindu received it, O Brahmin.

1.75 Tṛṇabindu taught it to [23/24] Vṛkṣa, Vṛkṣa to [24/25] Śakti [the fater of Parāśara].
Śakti taught it to [25/26] Parāśara, then [Parāśara] to [26/27] Jātūkarṇa.

1.76 Jātukarṇa taught it to [27/28] Dvaipāyana, the great sage.
Dvaipāyana, the great sage, gave it to [28/29] Romaharṣa.

1.77 He [Dvaipāyana] taught it to Romaharṣa, his brilliant son.
12,000 Purāṇa [verses?] have been revealed
for the benefit of humankind. What else do you wish to know?

1.78 Here ends the first chapter in the Vṛṣasārasaṃgraha called the enumeration of the Brahmāṇḍa[s?].
Vigatarāga spoke:
I, the Brahmin(? phps accept it) [rather:
through you, a Brahmin], have listened to the concise description of the Brahmāṇḍa,
it's extent, colour, form and the numbers associated with it.
You mentioned the Śivāṇḍa as taught to be the receptacle of the Brahmāṇḍa [see 1.40ab].
What are its characteristics and how much is its extent?
Whose dwelling/resting place is it [phps ālayana for ālaya]
and [what] is the extent/proof of the one who dwells there? [maybe the number of inhabitants Flo]
[Or: what is its extent and [who are its] inhabitants]?
Who are the people there? And who is Prajāpati there?
Anarthayajña spoke: Please don't ask me about the characteristics of the Śivāṇḍa, O Brahin.
How could even the gods have the power to really know and see...
...the path to the unattainable place which is extremely secret and [...]
There is no master or the opposite there, nobody to be punished and no punisher.
There are no truthful or untruthful people there, no moral or immoral people,
no wicked people, no hypocrisy, no thirst or envy.
There is no anger or desire, no arrogance or discontent ([a]sūyaka).
No envy or hatred, no cheaters and no jealousy.
There is no disease, no aging, no grief and no agitation there.
There are no inferior people or superior people and there is nobody in-between.
There are no privileged men or women there in Śiva's abode,
no reproach or praise, no selfish or treacherous people.
There is no pride or arrogance there, no cruelty or trickery and so on.
There are no beggars and no donors there.
Go without desires, being there you'll be resting under a wishing tree.
There is no karma there and no enemy. The era of strife [the Kali era] is not there and there is
no fight.
There is no Dvāpara era or Tretā or Kṛta.
There are no Manvantaras (1 Manvantara = 1000 Kalpas) there and no Kalpas.
No universal floods come, and there are no days and nights of Brahmā.
There is no birth and death there and one never encounters catastrophes.
Nobody is tied to noose of hope and there is no passion or delusion.
There are no gods and demons there and no Yakṣas, Serpents and Rākṣasas.
There are no Ghosts and Piśācas, no Gandharvas and Ṛṣis.
There are no asterisms and planets there, no Nāgas, Kiṃnaras or Garuḍa-like creatures.
There is no recitation there or daily rituals, nobody performs the Agnihotra and there is no sacrificer.
There are no religious observances and no austerities and no 'animal hell'.
Nobody would be able to tell the extent of the god Īśāna's powers starting with aiśvarya,
not even in a hundred years.
[Instead] I'll teach you all that are produced by Hara's wish one by one,
excluding the gods and people, starting with the trees, the bushes and creepers.
[Their?] height is two Parārdha, and [their?] width is the same.
There are lovely flowers of different forms and also lovely fruits.
There are also golden trees and also gem trees,
coral gem thickets and ruby plants.
There are trees with twigs on which creepers with tasty roots reach for the tasty fruits.
[REVISE]
All of them can change their shapes on their own accord [just bending etc.?] and
they fulfill man's desires and they whisper in a lovely way[?]
[any language? maybe not].
There [in the Śivāṇḍa], O Brahmin, all the subjects are the oceans of endless virtues.
They are all equally beautiful and strong, and they shine like millions of suns.
... is two Parārdha [yojanas] long and two Parārdha [yojanas] wide,
and two Parārdha yojanas is it its extension[?], O great Brahmin.
Authority is not a number [cannot be expressed by a number?
OR: there is no question of....?]
neither is the Power of strength, O Brahmin.
Down and up are no numbers [no question of going to heaven or hell?],
and nobody goes to the Tiryañc [hell] [??? OR with iti: there is no horizontal extension?].
I do not know the length and width of the Śivāṇḍa.
Enjoyment is undecaying there, and there is no birth or death there.
Inside the Śivāṇḍa, there is the dwelling-place of Īśāna's people [= Īśāna's region]
[on] one and a half Para krore [yojanas? or that many people?], who shine like cow's milk
[or the region shines?].
They are all like the rising sun in the House of Tatpuruṣa
[on] one and a half Para krore [yojanas? or that many people?] in the east.
All of them are like collyrium in the southern direction, in the House of Aghora,
[on] one and a half Para krore [yojanas?].
In the western direction, in Sadyojāta's beloved House, [on] one and a half krore [yojanas?]
they are like jasmine, the moon, like snowy rocks.
In the northern direction, in Vāmadeva's House of one and a half krore [yojanas?]
they are like saffron and water.
Īśāna has five parts (kalā), [his Tatpuruṣa] face has four.
Aghora has eight, and there are thirteen Vāmadeva[-kalā]s.
Sadyojāta has eight parts. These parts, altogether thirty-eight, which
liberate us from the ocean of existence, have been taught, O truest Brahmin.
Those who explore the Truth should know the numbers, the colours and
directions associated with each one [of Śiva's faces] in the way taught above.
If one has the intention to go to the Śivāṇḍa [if he is 'pulled' towards it],
one should practise Śiva yoga. Without Śiva yoga, O Brahmin, it is impossible to go there.
[Even] by performing millions of sacrifices such as the Aśvamedha,
or difficult austerities for a hundred Kalpas,
it is impossible to get there even for the gods, O great ascetic.
[Only] by bathing and performing austerities at sacred places such as the Gaṅgā,
even the honorable Ṛṣis will not be able to get there.
Or by donating the oceans of the seven islands with all their gems to a Veda expert, O Brahmin,
having faith and devotion, one will not be able to go there
without meditation. [This is a] certainty.
He who destroys his own body and gives it without hesitation
to those who are in need of it,
or gives his wife, his son and his possessions or his own head to those in need,
or by [performing] other difficult deeds, will not be able to go there.
He who has completed the sacrifices, the pilgrimages,
the austerities, the donations, the study of the Vedas,
will experience those enjoyments that the Brahmāṇḍa offers, still
subject to time and death.
Dharma decays with time that is sent by...
Like a circle of burning coal, time goes round and round.
Time is called 'kāla' because of the waves (kalana)
of the three divisions of time [past, present, future].

2.41 Here ends the second chapter in the Vṛṣasārasaṃgraha called the enumeration of the Śivāṇḍa.

5.1 Vigatarāga spoke:
Please definitely teach me the truth of the Niyama-rules now.
I have become curious about it, [because] it is like a speech on the nectar of immortality.
burnt by the fire of Prakṛti, sprinkled by the water of knowledge,...?
?? no satisfaction in Dharma.

5.2 Anarthayajña spoke:
I shall teach you something else which is nice to hear, O great Brahmin:
the particular parts of Niyama, of five times five types.
It is the essence of Dharma, dear to Hari, Hara and the sages, O great Brahmin,
the destruction of the impurity of the Kali age, known as liberation by death???

5.3 Purity, sacrifice, penance, donation, study and the restraint of sexual desire,
religious observances, fasting, silence, and bathing: these are the ten Niyamas.

5.4 From among these, now I shall teach you about purity [first, then] the others.
[1] Bodily purity, [2] [purity of] food, [3]...?, [4]...? , and the fifth, [5]...?

5.5 He should not beat or tie or kill [the body].
[This concerns] others' wives and property???? and is called bodily purity.

5.6 The cleanliness of the ears, O great Brahmin, and of the anus, the loin, the mouth etc.
The purity of the mouth [comes from] sipping water. [It is to be done] when eating, speaking,

5.7 [after] the emission of urine and faeces, and [before] the worship of gods.
The wise one should clean his anus and his loin with clay and water.

5.8 One [portion] for the loin, five for the anus, and ten for one [the left] hand.
[Then] seven is to be applied for both [hands] by him who wished cleanliness with clay.

5.9 This is the purification for the householder, twice as much for the chaste one.
Three times as much for the forest-dweller, four times as much for the ascetic.

5.10 I shall teach you the purification of food. Listen, pay great attention.
He should eat two units of food and drink one unit of water.

5.11 In order to be able to practise breath-control, he should save the remaining fourth.


5.17 
In the books of Manu, in the Purāṇas, in Śaivism, and in the Bhāratasaṃhitā,

5.18 the practice of purity is definitely expanded in full.
Now you have asked me [? about it], and I taught it [to you] in a condensed form.

11.1 The Goddess spoke:
O Paraśreṣṭha, O Surottama! Is there another [form of] universal [everybody can do it accessible to all] sacrifice,
which is free of pain, which is easy, and which does not require an abundance of materials, O Īśvara?
For the benefit of mankind, teach me, O Suraśreṣṭha, how one obtains the fruits
of [this] universal sacrifice, which [process] is praised even by the gods.

11.3 Maheśvara spoke:
I cannot see anything comparable to your compassion towards living beings, O Bhāminī.
What else could I teach concerning which there is no compassion [in you towards living beings]?

11.4 I heard [this] previously from Sadāśiva's mouth, O Varasundarī.
Listen, O Goddess, I shall teach you the ultimate essence of Dharma.

11.5 Immaterial sacrifice satisfies all desires.
It is undecaying and imperishable, and it removes all sins.

11.6 Material things cause many obstacles and much trouble,
similarly to Indra's murder of the Brahmin [Viśvarūpa],
which yielded fruits that were distributed [among trees, lands etc.].

11.7 Material sacrifice can be purified by the five purifications, O Varānanā.
If it is purified, then the fruits will also be pure.
If it is not purified, there is no fruit.

11.8 The Goddess spoke:
I am not sure about the five purifications, O Suraśreṣṭha.
Please teach [them to] me one by one, I want to hear [them] as [they] really [are].

11.9 Rudra spoke:
The first is the purification of the mind, then comes the purification of the substances.
The third is the purification of the mantras. The next one is the purification of the ritual.
The fifth is the purification of Sattva. The purification of the sacrifice is [thus] fivefold.

11.10 The purification of the mind is [achived] by mentally creating what is not wrong.
The purification of the substances is [achieved]
by [using] substances that were not obtained by unlawful means.

11.11 The purification of the mantras is [achived] by [properly] joining vowels to consonants.
The purification of the ritual is [achived] by not altering the proper sequence.
The purification of Sattva is [achived] by the non-prevalence of Rajas and Tamas.

11.12 When he has purified the ritual (vidhi) thus and performs the sacrifice,
he will obtain the fruits of the sacrifice, and will not experience birth and death [again].

11.13 [Perhaps:] But he who performs immaterial sacrifice, O Varasundarī,
will not obtain [only] its fruits, [but] of all sacrifices, without exception.

11.14 His sacrificial ground is Kurukṣetra, he has made his abode is the house of Truth/Sattva.
His great altar is the withdrawal of the senses. His seat of kuśa grass is self-control.

11.15 The injunction is the various .. . He lights the fire of meditation
which is flaring up by the fuel of the firewood of yoga and
is abounding in the smoke of penance.

11.16 The placing down of the chalice is knowledge about Śiva.
[The oblation of] boiled rice is [when] he becomes Śiva [?!].
The continuous oblation of clarified butter is poured
with the ladle of Lambaka [uvula, lambikā?].

11.17 Transforming concentration into an Adhvaryu [priest],
breath control will be the [other] priests.
Samādhi which involves Tarka and which is long is
the burning of the oblation[? vayas-tāpana?].

11.18 The sacrificial post is made up of the knowledge about Brahman.
The tying of the sacrificial animal is [the mental state called] Manonmanas.
His wife is Faith, O Viśālākṣī. His sacrificial ritual intention/declaration is the eternal abode.

11.19 Rice oblation is the consumption of the nectar of immortality
that arises from the victory over the five senses.
The great mantra is Brahmā's sound. Expiation is the victory over breath.

11.20 The consumption of Soma is complete knowledge.
The commencement [of the reading of the Veda] is the four yama-rules[?].
The ritual water-bath is [the reading of] epics [DG].
His garment is made of [his readings of] the Purāṇas.

11.21 Ritual bathing and at the same time sipping water are [to be performed]
at the confluence of the Iḍā and the Suṣumnā.
Having honoured Contentment as a guest, he salutes the Brahmin as Compassion.

11.22 The Brahmakūrca [penance] is the Guṇātīta [state of mind], the scent of the sacrifice is
the Nirañjana [state of mind].
[His] sacred thread is the three Tattvas.
For a shaven head he has enlightenment/teaching.

11.23 The four Vedas are Nivṛtti etc. His seat is the four Prakaraṇas.
He should always perform a sacrifice donating the priestly fee of
providing being[s] with freedom from danger.

11.24 The attainment of immaterial sacrifice has been taught to you, O Varānanā.
[The sacrificer] will in any case obtain the fruits of upto a thousand [ordinary] sacrifices.

11.25 The first life-stage [life option] has been taught to you, O Varānanā,
the true Dharma, which is revered by Sadāśiva and also by the [other] gods.

11.26 [Now] learn about brahmacarya. Listen with attention, O Śubhā.
[This is] the second life-stage, O Devī, the destroyer of all sins.

11.27 [Here] religious observance is [now] meditation on Brahman.
The Sāvitrī [hymn] is absorption in Prakṛti.
The Brahmanical cord is the subtle syllable.
The three guṇas are contained in his girdle.

11.28 His staff is self-restraint, his bowl compassion.
Begging/alms? is liberation from saṃsāra.
The three periods of life[?] is the one beyond the two syllables[?].
It[?] is embellished with the ashes of knowledge.

11.29 The bath-vow is speaking the truth always.
It is accompanied by the purity of moral conduct.
Sacrifice to Agni is the three tattvas[?].
Recitation is the sound at the aperture of Brahmā.

11.30 [This is] the second life-stage as Lord Śiva taught it, O Devī.
I have also taught [it to] you[,] the destruction of birth and death.

11.31 Listen, O Long-eyed goddess, I shall teach you the forest-dweller's way of life,
which is revered by the Ṛṣis and the gods, as I heard it, as it [really] is.

11.32 Having taken to the forest of indifference,
he should take residence in the Āśrama of niyama-rules,
within walls that have the stone-strong gate of moral conduct,
with his sense faculties conquered.

11.33 The spiritual substratum of material objects [adhibhūta?] is his mother,
the supreme spirit is his father.
the divine realm is his teacher, determination his brothers.

11.34 His wives are Śruti and Smṛti, his son is Wisdom,
his younger brother Patience.
His relative is Benevolence, his twisted hair is his bow,
Compassion his sacred thread.

11.35 Sympathy is the four ways of taciturnity. All his teendők... are Endurance.
He has the yama-rules for a garment made of bark, and he wears
Penance for the skin of a black antelope.

11.36 He is seated on the highest level of non-attachment,
and the firm observance is his yoga-belt.
The sound of murmuring the Vedas is noise[??]. Fire sacrifice is breath-control.

11.37 He is full of[??] conquered breaths for a deer[??].
[For him] sacrifice is resolution, ritual is recitation.
His companion from among all the collected teachings[??!]
of the Śāstras is self-control, compassion etc.

11.38 He should perform sacrifice to Śiva [with/as?] the worship of the eight [yogic?] practices.
He is purified by the water of the five Brahma[-mantras]
in the auspicious pool on the sacred banks of truthfulness.

11.39 Having bathed and having sipped water,
he should take refuge at [or rather upāsayet?] the three junctures of the day.
His rosary is the meaning of the Purāṇas.
The pacification of mantras? is? recitation day and night.

11.40 His jar of epics is filled with the water of knowledge.
[Tentatively:] The actions of the five [medical] procedures are suicide.
The five kinds of pleasure are recitation.[?]

11.41 The Śivasaṃkalpa [hymn] is practice (sādhana),
which yields fruits of yoga accomplishments.
His food is the fruit of Contentment. He conquered lust and anger.

11.42 His practice is the victory over the trap of hope.
He prefers the joy of yoga meditation.
The forest-dweller should observe his vow
by providing his guests with fearlessness.
This is how the Dharma of the forest-dweller has been taught in the past.

11.43 [If the yogin] follows, with faith and self-control, the supreme Dharma,
which delivers him from Saṃsāra, removes transient existence, uproots ignorance,
increases wisdom, which is fruitful, which delivers cross him from the flood of affliction,
removes birth, disease and burns bad karma,
he will really become a living Śiva.

11.44 Here follows the a wandering religious mendicant's Dharma.
Listen, I shall teach you about it.
Making joy and pain equal, he gets rid of greed and folly.

11.45 He should avoid honey and meat, as well as others' wives.
He should avoid staying [in a place] for long and also staying at others' places.

11.46 He should avoid food that has been thrown away and
he should avoid a single alms round[?? the same food?].
He should always refrain from accumulating wealth and from self-conceit.

11.47 Meditating on the subtle he can put his feet into the pure.[??]
He should not get angry when [food] in not available, and when it is, he should not rejoice.

11.48 He should not be agitated with regards to thirst for material things or to violent anger.
He should take praise and reproach equal, as well as pleasant and unpleasant things.

11.49 His garment is the Niyama-rules, and he is girded by the girdle of self-control.
He makes his mind supportless, his intellect spotless,

11.50 his self Earth, the Manonmana ether[?],
his three staffs the three guṇas, his bowl the imperishable syllable.

11.51 He should throw away [the distinction between?] Dharma and Adharma,
and should avoid envy and hatred.
He is indifferent to the opposites [such as cold and heat, good and bad],
dwells always in truthfulness, unselfish, humble.

11.52 He should go on his alms round visiting seven houses at the eighth part of the day.
He should not sit down, he should not stay, and he should not say `Give me!'.

11.53 He should live on what is available, on[?] eight bites a day.
He should not stick to items of clothes, food or a bed for long.

11.54 He should nor rejoice in death, he should not rejoice in life.
Having conquered his senses, having killed his desire, firm in his observances,

11.55 the Bhikṣu should never think about the past or the future.
The wandering mendicant should always avoid anger, self-conceit, intoxication and pride.

11.56 Making indifference a bow which is strung by the strings of breath-control,
he should kill the beast the sense-faculty which is
the mind with the sharp-pointed arrow of concentration.

11.57 He should stab the enemy that is saṃsāra with the extremely sharp
knife of friendliness.
He should defeat the rutting elephant of anger with the discus that is circle of compassion.

11.58 His body is clad in the armour of sympathy, his quiver is full of indifference.
He should constantly recall the unutterable syllable which is supreme Brahman, O Brahmin.

11.59 Brahmā's heart is Viṣṇu. Viṣṇu's heart is Śiva.
Śiva's heart is the Junctures of the day. Therefore he should worship the Junctures.

11.60 [Śiva] is deliverance from the ocean of mundane existence, the path to happiness, the Brahman,
the junctures, the [sacred] syllable.
[the yogin] should always, unweariedly, meditate on matchless Śiva,
who is to be recognized as the manifested soul.
He should take refuge in Hara, who is devoid[!] of form, colour, qualities etc.,
who is the supreme aim which is difficult to aim at,
... , the divine guru, who removes all pain.

12.1 The Goddess spoke:
Harmlessness is always praised as the highest Dharma.
Tell me the ultimate Dharma of the hospitable ones.

12.2 Maheśvara spoke:
Hear the ultimate Dharma of harmlessness and that of the hospitable ones.
O beautiful-eyed goddess, all the three worlds full of wealth

12.3 [as] a gift to [a Brahmin who] knows the four Vedas cannot be compared to somebody who avoids doing harm.
Hear [now] the Dharma of the hospitable ones. I'll teach it [to you], O beautiful one.
*******************
The Story of Vipula
*******************

12.4 This is an old story of what happened once in a city called Kusuma.
There was a famous wise man called Vipula, Kapila's son.

12.5 He always followed the Dharma, he conquered anger, and he spoke only the truth. He also conquered his senses.
He was favourable to Brahmin. He was not ungrateful DG and he was my determined devotee.

12.6 He was rich and he worshipped by his guests. He was generous, restrained, and merciful.
He wealth always came through just means, never injust.......

12.7 He had a beautiful wife whose face was as pure as the disk of the moon.
Her breasts were round and elevated, she was lovely and she was a source of all pleasure.
She was faithful, devoted to her husband and his needs.

12.8 Now, once there was an eclipse of the sun.
Three quarters [of the sun] were eclipsed, and it was in the dark half of the month Mādhava.

12.9 Eager to take a ritual bath, the king and all citizens went down [to the river].
They worshipped the gods and the deceased ancestors according to rule.

12.10 Some sacrificed in the fire, some fed the Brahmins,
some gave donations, others praised the deities.

12.11 Some people practised yoga meditation, others were engrossed in five-fire penance.
While all the royals and other people were doing this all around,

12.12 Vipula too, there at the confluence of the Gaṅgā and the Gaṇḍakī,
together with his wife, performed a bath, and, attired in linen clothes,

12.13 was satiating the deities, the gurus, the Brahmins and others.
Then, jumping on the possibility, a Brahmin came up [to them] as a guest.

12.14 The wife got infatuated with the Brahmin's extreme beauty.
The Brahmin too became ...? with [her] beauty.

12.15 Their gaze got fixed on each other mutually.
Vipula joined his hands [and said:] ``O virtuous Brahmin,

12.16 I am at your service, be gracious to me now, O great Brahmin.''
[He offered him?] his wife, servants, cattle, village and all kinds of jewels,

12.17 Having been addressed and greeted hospitably by Vipula, the Brahmin spoke:
``If you really mean to give, your heart is very generous.''

12.18 Vipula spoke:
``My heart is generous, generousity is the fruit of auserity.
Just command me quickly, O Brahmin. What is your desire?
There is nothing that should not be donated to a Brahmin, beginning with one's own head, O Brahmin.''

12.19 The Brahmin spoke:
``If you talk like this, my dear, give me your beautiful wife.
Be happy, may you be fortunate, and may you prosper eternally!''

12.20 Vipula spoke:
``Accept my wife who has nice buttocks, and is young and beautiful,
unreproached, large-eyed and whose face resembles the full-moon.''

12.21 The wife spoke:
``How can you abandon me, my lord? How can you leave me who am sinless?
How can somebody leave a wife who is extremely kind and faultless?

12.22 A wife is a man's friend in this world and in the other world.
[Even if] one gives enourmous donations or performs numerous sacrifices,

12.23 or performs hard penance, one cannot get to heaven if he hasn't got a son.
I have heard that this was taught by the ancestors, and by Brahmins in my presence.

12.24 The sonless cannot obtain heaven. I have heard this so many times!
Mandapāla, the great Brahmin went to heaven as a reward of his austerities,

12.25 and by his numerous donations and various sacrifices,
and by reciting the Vedas, and performing sacrifices, that[?] great Brahmin.

12.26 But when he reached the gate [of heaven], it was blocked by the celestial messengers:
``The sonless cannot get to heaven, not even by hundreds of sacrifices.''

12.27 Mandapāla, the great sage was thus informed and he fell from heaven.
The clever Brahmin begot sons who were born from a Śāraṅga-bird.

12.28 By the virtue of this, he reached heaven unobstructed.
I am a wife, who is for the protectors of the race, and a wife because I bear [sons].

12.29 Taking a wife is for the sake of having sons according to the Śāstras.
You can give the Brahmin all the wealth at home,
all the villages, the stations of herdsmen and the houses,

12.30 but please don't give me away!''
Having heard his wife's speach, Vipula spoke again:

12.31 Vipula spoke:
``Alright, my beautiful wife, I know! Good, good, my faithful wife!
I am beaten by this speach and I am satisfied with it.

12.32 Today the Brahmin came up to me at the time of eclipse, and asked me.
I promised him that I would give [you away]. If I don't don't give [you to him], I'll go to hell.

12.33 If I go to hell along with my family/decendants,
I will not be freed from hell, O Yaśasvinī, for millions of eons,

12.34 as long as millions of births.
I can see something bad, O Devī, from not giving, Varavarṇinī

12.35 and I can see eternal good in heaven from giving.
I have never ever lied, observing the vow of truthfulness.

12.36 Transgressing the law of truth, I would not follow any other law.
You mentioned earlier that the wife is one's Dharmic friend.

12.37 If you are indeed my Dharmic friend, then the time has come CHECK
was Dharma himself coming to me in the form of a Brahmin

12.38 to test me. O my dear, please don't cause me trouble.
The Unmenifest is my mother, Brahmā is my father, Intelligence is my wife, self-control is my friend.

12.39 Dharma is my son, Ritual is my guru. These are my relatives.
The best planet... the Sun, the best one among the rivers is the Gaṅgā.

12.40 The best day is at waning moon, the best man is the Brahmin.
I have given you to the Brahmin to serve him.
Having given everything to the Brahmin, I'll resort to the forest.''

12.41 Śaṅkara [i.e. Śiva] spoke:
The wife remained silent, her eyes filled with tears.
[Vipula] took her hand and the long-eyed one woman was presented to the Brahmin.

12.42 I am ready to give all the wealth I have at home, all the gold and the cattle,
O great Brahmin, and the .....

12.108 I went to Soma's world, and he gave me the magical fruit.

12.109 I cannot give you another one. Go now to Soma's city.
Gāyatrī, who is the mother of the Vedas, and beautiful Sāvitrī.
From ritual arises sacrifice. From sacrifice arises smoke.

13.18 From the clouds food arises. From food living beings arise.
From food arises rasa. From rasa arises blood.

13.19 From blood flesh arises. From flesh fat arises.
From fat bones arise. From the bones marrow arises.

13.20 From marrow arises semen. And man is born from semen.

16.1 *******************
The exposition of the essence of yoga
*******************
Devī spoke:
Now I would like to hear the exposition of the essence of yoga.
Furthermore teach me about the Karaṇa [exercises?], according to the rules, O Sureśvara.

16.2 Īśvara spoke:
Listen, o Devī, I shall teach you the supreme essence of yoga,
by knowing which people will cease to experience the fetter of mundane existence.

16.3 [One can be] a Brahmin-slayer, a violator of his teacher's bed, a drunkard, a thief
or can be born into a mixed caste: it [i.e. yoga] will eliminate all [of his sins].

16.4 He who engages in Prāṇāyāma for [just] half a moment or for a moment,
[and] focuses on the object to be visualized (dhyeya) will have his sins destroyed ... [kṣaṇāt? cf. parallel]

16.5 Mighty [balavat] Yama, the cruel Ender, frightening-looking death
will not take possession of the brave yogin.

16.6 Just as the faults of all metals are burnt out by blowing [the fire that heats] them,
in the same way sins are surely burnt away by the control of the breath.

16.7 There is nothing like a thousand Aśvamedha sacrifice, a hundred Rājasūya ritual
or a hundred [rounds of] prāṇāyāma.

16.8 By sacrifice, one can reach the gods [Veda?]. The result of asceticism is sovereignty [Yoga?].
By renunciation, one gets to Brahmā's place, and by indifference, to Prakṛti's abode.

16.9 By knowledge, one attains kaivalya and the supreme and eternal Brahman [Sāṃkhya?].
These are taught to be the five paths according to the rules.

16.10 If the knower of yoga practises yoga for half a moment or for a moment,
he will get beyond all sins and will attain immortality.

16.11 Even if he practises diligently, until he knows the Truth,
he will surely abide in Brahmā's and Viṣṇu's homes, O Sundarī.

16.12 He will experience thousands of karmas, while he has all possible desires.
Then when his merits are exhausted, he will be born in the world of mortals, in a noble family.

16.13 He should practise only yoga, and he will be a man who remembers his own previous births.
Crossing the ocean of mundane existence, he will obtain Śivaness.
*******************
The technique of yoga
*******************

16.14 Devī spoke:
I wish to hear about the method of yoga. Teach me, O Puruṣottama, O Sureśvara, about
[the methods] of meditation, concentration and of [obtaining] Powers.

16.15 Maheśvara spoke:
Listen, I shall teach you the method of yoga, the destroyer of the noose of existence.
[With his body] purified and his mind concentrated, the yogin should sit down assuming a sitting posture (āsana) in a place which is devoid of humans and noise,
and he should think of the Supreme Soul.

16.16 [The āsanas are:] padmaka, svastika, niṣkala, añjali,
ardhacandra, daṇḍa, paryaṅka, and bhadra.

16.17 He should practise yoga by assuming [any one of] these āsanas.
He should hold his trunk, head and neck in one line, motionless.

16.18 Withdrawal of the senses (pratyāhāra), meditation (dhyāna), breat-controll (prāṇayāma), concentration (dhāraṇā),
reflection (tarka), and samādhi: these are called the six-limbed yoga/ yoga with six ancillaries.

16.19 That [method] which draws in the senses that are clinging on to the objects again and again [see DhP]
with the help of the mind is called withdrawal of the senses.

16.20 O Devī, [the yogin] should concentrate on the [five] sense-objects beginning with sound after he has made them into a ball.
His passions gone, dwelling in samādhi, he should join the object of meditation with the object[?].

16.21 The Self is the meditator (dhyātṛ), the mind is meditation (dhyāna), the object of meditation (dhyeya) is Pure Supreme Śiva
As regards supreme sovereignty, [that] is the only aim in it [i.e. in dhyāna].

16.22 Inhalation, breath retention, then exhalation,
and the tranquillized one: prāṇāyāma is fourfold.

16.23 During inhalation, the wise one should establish the fire through his great-toe.
By breath retention he should stop it [i.e. the fire] and visualize it [i.e. himself] as being burnt.

16.24 Then, while exhaling, he should imagine himself as reduced to ashes.
Now his Self has a purified body, one which is as spotless as a clear crystal.

16.25 [When this is maintained for] twelve measures of time, that is called nirvāṇa/exhalation?
Concentration (dhāraṇā) is twice as long as breath-control (prāṇāyāma), there is no doubt about it.

16.26 As regards yoga, it (dhāraṇā?) is said to be three times as long,
in saṃkrama it is four times longer.
In case of ritual suicide (utkrānti) is concerned,
it is five times longer. [To reach] yogic Powers (yogasiddhi) [it takes] six times longer.

16.27 [The yogin should] always be practising yoga with the six ancillaries.
Yoga is taught as having two forms: mental (mānasa) and simultaneous?? (yaugapadya).

16.28 [The yogin] can meditate on the supreme subtle one only mentally, without performing breath-control:
that type of yoga is called mental [yoga] (mānasa).

16.29 [If the yogin] controls his breath with his mind, and his mind with breath-control,
and thus meditates on the supreme subtle one, that is called simultaneous [yoga] (yaugapadya).

16.30 I shall teach you the signs of success in yoga, listen, O Sundarī.
Conch-shell, kettle-drum, mṛdaṅga-drum, flute, dundubhi-drum:
[when these are] beaten, he does not perceive [the sound] when he has reached such-ness [i.e. Śivaness].

16.31 Similarly, he will not be able to tell cold from heat, joy from sadness, he will not experience thirst or hunger
or pain, when he attains success in yoga, O Sundarī.

16.32 This is how I taught the technique of yoga in a nutshell, O Devī, because of your question, O Sundarī.
What else shall I teach you?

16.33 Devī spoke:
Tell me about the liberation from mundane existence without yoga, O Deveśa!
O Mahādeva, [that could] free [one's] mind of doubts/hesitation.

16.34 Maheśvara spoke:
Sighing is Sadāśiva, a deep breath is supreme Śiva.
In between the two, there is Śiva the supreme and imperishable Self.

16.35 For one [who knows this], there is neither yoga meditation and nor karaṇa.
He is liberated by [the] mere knowledge [of this]. What else do you want to ask?

16.36 I shall teach you another kind of knowledge. Listen, O Devī, listen to me.
Listen in short to the [its] exposition as constructed in the five śāstras,
in Sāṃkhya, in yoga, in the Pañcarātra, in Śaivism and in the Vedas.

16.37 The quintessential yoga which is established in Sāṃkhya, and which is for [liberation from] the terrible ocean of mundane existence,
and which I am teaching you now,
is certainly there for you as a certainty in essential yoga [teachings], and in the Pañcarātra,
in the Vedas, and in Śaivism.

16.38 If all of [his] senses beginning with smelling,
and also his mind, are dissolved, so to say,
and if he suppresses all sensations (bhāva) with his mind,
he will attain his aim and will find refuge in Śiva.

16.39 [When there is] motionlessness of all senses beginning with hearing,
and his attention (cittaṃ), controlled by his mind, becomes focused (ekāgra),
his body will slowly disappear.
This is called `success in union' by the experts.

16.40 First, he should slowly stop his mind [or subj. = manas?], subduing the sense[s]
until it [the senses] dissolve[s] together with the mind [see above]. Thus [the yogin's] body is rendered unconscious/senseless.
[The yogin] certainly attains this yoga in its entirety, namely meditation and samādhi.
Why is it [if] somebody does not seek [this] essence extracted[? mathitam might be better] from ten thousand million books?

16.41 He has conquered his joy in his Self, [instead] he rejoices in samādhi and he has also taken refuge in indifference (vairāgya).
When the end comes, his mind will remain [in] corporal form???
That is to be known as the highest path, Śiva's abode, which puts an end to mundane suffering.
And this is taught as `completion' [niṣṭhā!] in the Vedānta (in the Upaniṣads?). Why should anyone resort to any other teaching?

16.42 On [upari, here with loc.] the pericarp of the heart-lotus, there is a sun, illuminating the intermediate space.
There is a lamp lit by the shining of the most dense mass of rays of its light,
which having pierced the mouth at the soft palate, goes upwards through the soft palate towards the top of the head.
Those practising yoga leave for Śiva's supreme abode through the door on the top of their heads.

16.43 [Tentative:] Kṛṣṇa, the highest of the darkest ones, the extremily great one, who is essentially the splendour of light/who shines/is sharp, the one who has never been born,
the supporter of the world and the non-world and of the earth, husband to Śrī, abiding in the breath,
the imperishable creator, the imperishable cause,[?] he the [all-]pervading, the arranger/distributor?, ...?
Viṣṇu, ..., the lord of the universe, the omniscient one.

16.44 is viewing the senses and the mind inside the body through the Buddhi which is transformed by meditation.
That Puruṣa is located in the abode in the heart-lotus, he who gives us exhalation and inhalation.

16.45 He who is intensifying energy, the unborn one, who is a very dense mass, who is hidden in the garland of knots,
the embodiment, who follows the embodied form, ...
piercing the knot together with the bond, abandoning the objects of the senses and attachment like poison, focusing their states of mind,
they can see him, the God, who is devoid of [even] a small portion of the Guṇas, and who is formless light.

16.46 He whose inner self is energy, and who is hiding in the contracted place in the abode which is the hollow of the lotus [in the heart],
who resembles the Moon's light, who is always hidden in the pericarp among the spotless petals,
is, while remaining in that place, the abode of the three worlds and the home of all beings,
free of bondage, the one with the crescent moon, being at the Tattva above space.

16.47 These are all the Tattvas, O Devī.
The five-fold classification has been taught in short.
What other topic do you wish to hear,
[something] related to liberation from saṃsāra?

16.48 O God, I am satisfied. Now my doubts have been removed.
Now you are a gracious supreme Lord, O Īśvara!
Now I have heard FROM you the power of the fruits of merit.

21.1 Vigatarāga spoke:
Bravo, O best of the wise, bravo, O best of the ones who maintain Dharma!
Bravo self-control, bravo tranquillity! Bravo sacrifice, bravo penance!

21.2 By this nectar-like speech [of yours], my amazement has risen considerably.
And I am pleased with the extraordinary flavour of knowledge based on penance.

21.3 What kind of boon [shd be m.!] shall I give you? Tell me. I'll give you anything you desire.
Having heard this, he [therefore] replied with appropriate words.

21.4 [Anarthayajña spoke:]
Who are you, O best of benefactors? Are you a god, a Dānava-demon or a Rākṣasa?
Or rather [you must be] Lord Viṣṇu, who has come to test me.

21.5 I recognize you clearly, O best of men, O highest person!
Display your [true] Form, O Govinda, if penance can yield fruit.

21.6 Then lotus-eyed Hari displayed his own [true] body,
holding in his hands a conch-shell, a discus and a mace, wearing yellow garments.

21.7 Seeing him, Anarthayajña was truly amazed.
Thrilled by unequalled delight, his eyes filled with tears,

21.8 his voice trembling, he began speaking to Janārdana [i.e. Viṣṇu].
My birth and my austerities have now borne their fruits.

21.9 Obeisance to you who are the origin of man and other [living beings]! [?]
Obeisance to you who are the universe!
Obeisance to you who [transforming into a person? DG]
Obeisance to you from whom Brahmā was born!

21.10 Obeisance to you who have a thousand heads!
Obeisance to you who have a thousand eyes!
Obeisance to you who have a thousand liṅgas!
Obeisance to you who have a thousand chests!

21.11 Obeisance to you who have a thousand embodiments!
Obeisance to you who have a thousand arms!
Obeisance to you who have a thousand faces!
Obeisance to you who have a thousand supernatural powers!

21.12 Obeisance to you who assumed the form of a boar!
Obeisance to you who [in that form] dug out and saved the Earth!
Obeisance to you who create all living beings!
Obeisance to you on whom the four life-stages depend [seat of...]!

21.13 Obeisance to you who assumed the form of the Man-lion!
Obeisance to you who [in that form] tore asunder the chest of Diti's son [Hiraṇyakaśipu]!
Obeisance to you who destroyed the armies [conj.] of the Asuras!
Obeisance to you who destroyed the Asuras' haughtiness!

21.14 Obeisance to you who tamed Diti's son [Bali?]!
Obeisance to you who destroyed Bali's sacrifice!
Obeisance to you of the three steps/Trivikrama!
Obeisance to you who drove away the pain of the thirty gods!

21.15 Obeisance to you who are imperishable, O endless one!
Obeisance to you who drive away the pain of the world!
Obeisance to you who killed [the Asuras] Madhu and Kaiṭa[bha]!
Obeisance to you who are the friend of the three worlds!

21.16 Obeisance to you who are the delight of the thirty gods!
Obeisance to you who possess divine vision!
Obeisance to you who have gone beyond the limits of existence!
Obeisance to you who are worshipped by the three worlds!

21.17 Obeisance to you who hold a mace in [one of] your right[?] hand[s]!
Obeisance to you who hold an excellent discus in your hand!
Obeisance to you who hold a conch-shell in your hand!
Obeisance to you who hold a conch-shell[? rather: lotus] in your hand!

21.18 Obeisance to you who recline on the ocean!
Obeisance to you who have the form that crushed Hara [the Dānava?]!
Obeisance to you whose banner has the King of Birds [Garuḍa] [on it]!
Obeisance to you whose eyes are the Sun and the Moon!

21.19 Obeisance to you whose vehicle is the Enemy of Serpents [i.e. Garuḍa]!
Obeisance to you who display your extraordinary form!
Obeisance to you whose splendour is that of a hundred thousand suns!
Obeisance to you who was, [in your Kūrma-avatāra] the firm support at the churning out of the divine nectar!

21.20 Obeisance to you who are praised in the world of immortals!
Obeisance to you who are the seat of the temple of the world!
Obeisance to you, the only one affectionate towards the world!
Obeisance to you who bestow happiness on everyone, obeisance!

21.21 O Govinda, forgive my sin.
As you were asking me very actively, I, being a wicked person,
told you all this out of arrogance.
Have pity on me, Lord of the thirty gods [instr.?].

21.22 Vaiśampāyana spoke:
Keśava, the destroyer of the heroes of the enemy, was satisfied by this hymn of praise.
He, the great general, replied in a ... [nirupaspṛhā/spṛhayā] voice.

21.23 I am satisfied by this hymn of praise of me, dear Sir. I am vehemently trembling [with joy].
I'll grant you any boon you desire even if it is something difficult to obtain in the three worlds.

21.24 [He who] praises me with this ....?  [hymn]
that you recited and which is fascinating because it contains the meaning of the Vedas,
will dwell in heaven for as many aeons
as the number of syllables in it.

21.25 And you should choose a boon at your pleasure,
fearlessly, beginning from sovereignty over the three worlds.
Shall I grant you sovereignty over the seven-fold[?] world?
Or a heap of gold? Or many girls?

21.26 Hearing the divine boons [offered] [em. to vacam?] by the imperishable one,
he bowed down to his lotus-feet.
Having recognized that Viṣṇu was being most generous,
with a delighted heart....[to be reconstructed]

21.27 Anarthayajña spoke:
I do not desire anything else as a gift, O God.
The essence of bondage is without doubt one [thing??].
I have been freed from this bondage by your Lordship's grace,
and, O Govinda, I am delighting in Dharma.

21.28 The Lord spoke:
The extent to which your mind has been enlightened
O great sage, is something even the gods have never seen,
[this] spotless freedom from suffering.
The ocean of existence has certaily been crossed.

21.29 Well, let's go now to the White Island,
which is hidden and is inaccessible even for the gods.
He who dies after his mind has been purified by devotion towards me,
will never again enter the dreadful ocean [of existence].

21.30 Vaiśampāyana spoke:
Having spoken thus, then Hari took the great ascetic by the hand,
who disappeared in that moment, and with him Keśava, too.

21.31 Thus, as a consequence of the abundance of Dharma[?? in him?],
he [Anarthayajña] reached world of the Highest Person,
of the one who is the origin of all living beings, and who is imperishable,
the eternal and never-ending [world] of the never-decaying.

21.32 You yourself should be loyal to Keśava,
to Janārdana of unmeasurable heroism,
so that you can tread the path of that excellent Brahmin,
that excellent person.

21.33 What else should I teach you further, O king?
If you have any curiosity remaining,
ask me,  Sir, whatever you want
regarding the future or the past, anything you wish, Sir.

21.34 Janamejaya spoke:
How many kalpas have passed until now?
How many are the future kalpas?
How many Indras are taught to exist with regard to each aeon?
Tell me one by one[???].

21.35 Vaiśampāyana spoke:
100,000 billions of Kalpas have passed so far [rājyam? / rājan?].
There are fourteen Indras in one Kalpa, O king.
The same [number applies to] Manvantaras per Kalpa.
The future Kalpas are again 100,000 billion.

21.36 The first Kalpa was the Varāhakalpa.
Six Manvantaras have passed, O King.
Seventy-one four-fold [Mahā]yugas
is the number that applies to a Manvantara.

21.37 Fourteen Manvantara-periods
is one Kalpa, according to the sages.
Ten thousand Kalpas is Brahmā's day.
His night is [of] the same [length] according to the experts.

21.38 Six hundred-thousand Kalpas is called a [cosmic] month.
Twelve of them is called a year.

21.39 Brahmā's life is said to be that year multiplied by 100,000 billions of Kalpas[?].
But even Brahmā, the Lord of the three worlds, the supreme person, is taught to be transient.
Why should we grieve over the rest of the four kinds of living beings and the fate[?] of the soul?
Therefore there is nothing that is untouched by the fine[?] essence of the world except for eternal Śiva.

22.1 Janamejaya spoke:
I have heard from [your] lotus-mouth the ultimate compendium on the essence of Dharma,
in the proper way, together with the meaning of the Vedas, conveyed by sweet and polished speech.

22.2 This great essence is systematic (nyāyayukta), and it is the supreme secret knowledge.
I am satisfied now having drunk the nectar of immortality that removes birth, death and disease.

22.3 I want to ask you another question, O great ascetic, which concerns the name [Anarthayajña].
I would like to hear about your [rather: his] Varṇa, Gotra and Āśrama.

22.4 Vaiśampāyana spoke:
Listen, O King, attentively.
I shall tell you about the Āśrama, the Varṇa and the Jāti of the great and noble yogin, O king.

22.5 In the southern region of the Himālaya, on the Mṛgendra peak, O king,
on the banks of the river Mahendrapathagā[?], O King,

22.6 there was his hermitage.
The illustrous one lived on the beautiful banks [of the river],
having reached the other shore of Truth, free from desire,

22.7 leading a moral and pure life, with all opposites [such as happiness and pain]
and weakness conquered,
with all arrogance, fear, anger and greediness conquered.

22.8 The Kṣatriyas born in the Soma clan became Brāhmaṇas.
Because of [the] penance [they performed],
[and because of their] discipline and good conduct, Viṣṇu made them Brāhmaṇas.

22.9 Before that [they were] called Ajitas[?]
by the one who has conquered lust and anger.
O great King, I shall tell you about his vow, listen.

22.10 He flourished[?] in the town of the Spirit,
which is[?] populated by Matter[?],
in the vicinity of the divine realm[?],
the ten abodes and the five [phps Sāṃkhyatattvas??].

22.11 The vow of ten sacrifices was observed and he conquered the ten desires.
He followed the ten Niyama-rules. The ten winds were his priest.

22.12 With the ten-syllable mantra, he was at the level of the ten Dharmic rituals[???].
His ten sense faculties had the energy of the flames
in the [sacrificial] fire lit by the ten saṃyamas.

22.13 He practised the ten yogic sitting positions and focused on the ten ways of meditation.
His intellect was his altar, his mind the sacrificial post,
and Soma consumption was the immortal syllable.

22.14 The priestly fee was fearlessness offered to living beings,
the tying of the sacrificial animal was performed on[?] himself.
He spent his time performing immaterial sacrifice [thus].
The sages, who know the truth, call him Anarthayajña.

22.15 Janamejaya spoke:
Please let me hear about the ten sacrifices, O best of Brahmins,
and about the ten desires and the ten kinds of meditation,
the ten yoga[-āsana]s and the ten-syllable [mantra].

22.16 Vaiśampāyana spoke:
Sacrifice to Brahman, to the Devas, the Ancestors, the Ghosts, the Guests,
recitation, yoga, penance, meditation and [Vedic?] study: these are the ten [sacrifices].

22.17 Wife, son, cattle, servant, wealth, grain, fame, beauty,
respect, and enjoyment as the tenth, O king: the ten desires have been taught.

22.18 Mental, simultaneous and condensed [yoga], O king,
and the yoga named Viśālā, and also the one known as Dvikaraṇa,

22.19 sun, moon, fire, crystal and sky.
Always sitting in [one of] the ten yoga positions, the great ascetic

22.20 when his mind is still not under control, should visualize the subtle [atom?].
This is mental yoga.
When he can control his mind with breath-control, that is called simultaneous [yoga].

22.21 He should visualize the universe with all its moving and
parts, from Brahmā to a tuft of grass,
as gradually dissolving, and should reflect upon the subtle [atom?]:

22.22 this is called condensed [yoga]. Now listen to the Viśālā.
The wise one should call to mind [everything] from Brahmā to the subtle.

22.23 He should visualize both the condensed and the Viśālā mutually [one after the other? DG],
this is the yoga method called Dvikaraṇī.

22.24 He should imagine his heart in the center of his body,
and that there is a lotus in his heart.
In the center of the lotus, know that there is a pericarp, O king.

22.25 The wise ones know that there are five dots in the center of the pericarp:
the sun, the moon, the flame, the crystal and the sky.

22.26 He should visualize the disk of the moon in the centre of the sun.
In the centre of that [i.e. the moon], he should visualize fire that blazes without smoke.

22.27 In the centre of the fire, he should visualize a gem which has the splendour of a jet of clear water.
In its center, he should visualize the sky, subtle and imperishable Śiva.

22.28 This is how I taught you the ten yogas, O king.
The ten ways of meditation are taught in short as here follows, listen.

22.29 Sound, yellow, lightning, Candramālinī,
moon, pleasing, well-done,

22.30 Saumyā, spotless and supportless.
[1] Putting[?] two fingers in his ears, one can hear[!] sounds.

22.31 Having heard this and that syllable, he is fit for immortality.
[2] He should continuously visualize yellow, smokeless[?] flames tirelessly.

22.32 He will be freed of all his sins and will reach the level without opposites.
[3] The lightning in the middle of the night marks the unborn of no diseases.

22.33 After five months of continuous practice, men will develop divine sight.
[4] Then he should visualize the Bindumālā [Candramālā??] which rests in the shadow of a tree.

22.34 [5] Seeing it as genuine crystal, he is liberated from the fetters.
[6] He should visualize the Pleasing one ... ? pressing it in the eye.

22.35 When he sees the white and yellow and red drop, he will not be born again.
These are the six ways of meditation, the Pleasing one and the others, as I taught them to you.
