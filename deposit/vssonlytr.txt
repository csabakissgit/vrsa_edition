[--- Invocation ---]




[--- The dialogue of Janamejaya and Vaiśampāyana ---]

[0;33;40m1.2
Having bowed to the One who has no beginning, no middle part and no end, whose boundaries are limitless, who is very subtle and who is the unmanifest and fine essence of the world, [together with?] to the One who is wholly complete with Hari, Indra, Brahmā and the other [gods], I shall recite [the work called] `A Compendium on the Essence of the Bull [of Dharma]'. Having listened to the ŁBhāratasaṃhitā$ [i.e. the ŁMahābhārata$], the supreme book of a hundred thousand [verses] and a thousand chapters (Ładhyāya$), with all its hundred sections (Łparvan$), 

[0;33;40m1.3
Janamejaya remained unsatisfied. Listen unweariedly to what he asked Vaiśampāyana in the past. 

[0;33;40m1.4
Janamejaya spoke: O venerable sir, O knower of the entire Dharma, O you who are well-versed in all the sciences (Łśāstra$)! There is a supreme and secret Dharma [that brings about] liberation from the ocean of mundane existence (Łsaṃsāra$). 

[0;33;40m1.5
Teach me the Dharma that emerged from [Vyāsa] Dvaipāyana's mouth, O best of Brahmins. Help me find satisfaction at all cost, O great ascetic! 

[0;33;40m1.6
Vaiśampāyana spoke: Listen with great attention, O king, to this unsurpassed narration of Dharma. Hear the secret Dharma that I received by Vyāsa's favour. 

[0;33;40m1.8
|F| Viṣṇu, the great Lord, assuming the form of a twice-born [Brahmin], wanted to test [Anarthayajña, the ascetic yogin] who performed nonmaterial sacrifices (Łanarthayajña$), focused on his austerities and observances, whose conduct was virtuous and pure, and who was intent on compassion towards all living beings; therefore he [Viṣṇu] humbly asked him a question. 




[--- The knowledge of Brahman ---]

[0;33;40m1.9
[Vigatarāga spoke:] How is the knowledge of the Brahman to be understood if it is devoid of form and colour? Why is that supreme syllable that is devoid of vowels and consonants the supreme one? 

[0;33;40m1.10
Anarthayajña replied: That syllable is not to be pronounced, is unquestionable, non-dividable, consistent, spotless, all-pervading and subtle: what could be higher than that? 




[--- The noose of death and time ---]

[0;33;40m1.11
Vigatarāga spoke: When the body disintegrates in the ground, in water, in fire, or [is torn apart] by jackals and other [animals], how is the supportless and spotless soul led [to the netherworld] by Yama's messengers? 

[0;33;40m1.12
How is it bound by the nooses of death/time? And if it is bodiless, how can it move? And how does the [soul of a] virtuous [person] (Łbahudharmakṛt$) reach heaven if it has no body? This is my doubt. Teach me. I want to know the truth. 

[0;33;40m1.13
Anarthayajña spoke: You are asking me about an extremely doubtful and problematic matter, O truest of the twice-born. [This is something that] is difficult to understand by humans, and [even] by gods (Łdeva$), demons (Łdānava$) and serpents (Łpannaga$). 

[0;33;40m1.14
The cause of both the birth and death of the body is karma. Good and bad deeds are called the two nooses. 

[0;33;40m1.15
[The soul] goes to hell or heaven accordingly. Happiness and suffering, both arising from karma, are to be experienced by the body. 

[0;33;40m1.16
It is for this reason, O great Brahmin, that the human body is born. Now learn about that which they call the noose of time, I shall teach you, O you of great observances. 

[0;33;40m1.17
[If] you don't know anything, how could you start your investigation, O twice-born? O great Brahmin, you should know the noose of time in its entirety. 

[0;33;40m1.18
Learn about time (Łkāla$) which is divided into digits (Łkalā$), [i.e. about] the division[s] (Łkalā$) of the entity [called] time (Łkālatattva$). Two atomic units of time (Łtruṭi$) is one twinkling (Łnimeṣa$). One digit (Łkalā$, cca. 1.6 second) is twice a twinkling. 

[0;33;40m1.19
Two digits (Łkalā$) form one bit (Łkāṣṭhā$, 3.2 seconds). Thirty bits (Łkāṣṭhā$) is one digit (Łkalā$?, 1.6 minutes). Thirty digits (Łkalā$) make up one section (Łmuhūrta$, 48 minutes) in human terms, O great Brahmin. 

[0;33;40m1.20
Thirty sections (Łmuhūrta$) are known to the wise as night and day [i.e. a full day]. Thirty days and nights are taught by the wise to be one month. 

[0;33;40m1.21
One year is twelve months [according to] people who know the entity of time. The time span of three hundred 

[0;33;40m1.22
and sixty thousand years by human terms is said to be the Kali age (Łyuga$). The Dvāpara age is known to be twice as long as the Kali age. 

[0;33;40m1.23
The Tretā age is thrice [as long], the Kṛta age four [times as long as the Kali age]. This is the figure related to the four ages (Łyuga$). Taking it seventy-one [times], 

[0;33;40m1.24
the knowledge about one time-span of a Manu (Łmanvantara$) has been taught briefly. One ae on (Łkalpa$) is fourteen Łmanvantara$s in total. 

[0;33;40m1.25
Brahmā's day (Łbrahmāhar$) is made up of ten thousand Kalpas. [Brahmā's] night is of the same [duration] according to the wise who know the truth. 

[0;33;40m1.26
When [Brahmā's] night falls, the whole moving and unmoving universe dissolves. And when [his] daylight comes, the moving and unmoving [universe] is born. 

[0;33;40m1.27
One Łpara$ times Łparārdha$ [number of, i.e. two hundred quadrillion times a hundred quadrillion] Łkalpas$ have passed [so far], O great Brahmin. Bhṛgu and the other sages say that the future is the same [time span]. 

[0;33;40m1.28
Just as the sun, the planets, the stars and the moon are percieved in this world as wandering around, wandering on the wheel of time (Łkālacakra$), we can never have a rest. 

[0;33;40m1.29
Time creates living beings and time destroys them again. Everything is under the control of time. There is nothing that can bring time under control. 

[0;33;40m1.30
Fourteen Łparārdha$ [fourteen hundred quadrillion] god kings, O Brahmin, have passed by over time, for time is difficult to overcome. 

[0;33;40m1.31
Time is [manifest] as a great yogin, as Brahmā, Viṣṇu and supreme Śiva, is beginningless and endless, is the creator, the great soul. Pay homage [to Time]. 




[--- The Łparārdha$ etc.: numbers ---]

[0;33;40m1.32
Vigatarāga spoke: I have now heard about the `wheel of time' (Łkālacakra$) from [your] lotus mouth. [I am] excited to hear about [the terms] Łparārdha$ and Łpara$ [mentioned above]. 

[0;33;40m1.33
Anarthayajña spoke: One, ten, a hundred, a thousand, and ten thousand (Łayuta$), a hundred thousand (Łprayuta$), a million (Łniyuta$), ten million (Łkoṭi$), a hundred million (Łarbuda$), and one billion (Łvṛnda$, 10<tothepowerof>9</tothepowerof>), 

[0;33;40m1.34
ten billion (Łkharva$), a hundred billion (Łnikharva$), one trillion (Łśaṅku$, 10<tothepowerof>12</tothepowerof>), and ten trillion (Łpadma$), a hundred trillion (Łsamudra$), one quadrillion (Łmadhya$, 10<tothepowerof>15</tothepowerof>), ten quadrillion (Ł[an]anta$), a hundred quadrillion (Łparārdha$), and two hundred quadrillion (Łpara$). 

[0;33;40m1.35
Each should be known as powers of ten up to Łparārdha$. The number corresponding to Łpara$ is double that of Łparārdha$. 

[0;33;40m1.36
There is no higher number than Łpara$. This is my firm conviction, which is based on my readings of the Purāṇas and the Vedas and [which I have now] taught [to you], O great Brahmin. 




[--- Brahmā's Egg: the Universe ---]

[0;33;40m1.37
Vigatarāga spoke: What is the extent of the Brahmāṇḍa [i.e. the universe]? Is it disclosed anywhere? From how many finger's breadths high does the sun heat the earth? 

[0;33;40m1.38
Anarthayajña spoke: How could I enumerate [all the details of] the Brahmāṇḍa, O twice-born? Even the gods do not know, not to mention humans. 

[0;33;40m1.39
I shall teach [you], as far as I can, in due order and truthfully, that, O great Brahmin, which Mātariśvan was taught by Brahmā in the past. 

[0;33;40m1.40
Ten names of all the [cosmic] rulers of each of the eight directions in Brahmā's Egg, [which is] inside Śiva's Egg, are being taught now, listen. 




[--- The names of the cosmic rulers ---]

[0;33;40m1.41
[1] Sahā, [2] Asaha, [3] Saha, [4] Sahya, [5] Visaha, [6] Saṃhata, [7] Asabhā, [8] Prasaha, [9] Aprasaha, [10] Sānu: [these are] the ten Leaders in the East. 

[0;33;40m1.42
[1] Prabhāsa, [2] Bhāsana, [3] Bhānu, [4] Pradyota, [5] Dyutima, [6] Dyuti, [7] Dīptatejas, [8] Tejas, [9] Tejā, [10] Tejavaho: [these are] the ten [rulers] in the direction of Agni [SE]. Now listen to [the names for] Yama's region, O twice-born. 

[0;33;40m1.43
[1] Yama, [2] Yamunā, [3] Yāma, [4] Saṃyama, [5] Yamuna, [6] Ayama, [7] Saṃyana, [8] Yamanoyāna, [9] Yaniyugmā, [10] Yanoyana. 

[0;33;40m1.44
[1] Nagaja, [2] Naganā, [3] Nanda, [4] Nagara, [5] Naga, [6] Nandana, [7] Nagarbha, [8] Gahana, [9] Guhyo, [10] Gūḍhaja: [these are] the ten associated with [the South-West]. 

[0;33;40m1.45
I shall teach you [the names] in Varuṇa's region [in the west]. Listen, O Brahmin, learn from me. [1] Babhra, [2] Setu, [3] Bhava, [4] Udbhadra, [5] Prabhava, [6] Udbhava, [7] Bhājana, [8] Bharaṇa, [9] Bhuvana, and [10] Bhartṛ: these ten dwell in Varuṇa's region [in the west]. 

[0;33;40m1.46
[1] Nṛgarbha, [2] Asuragarbha, [3] Devagarbha, [4] Mahīdhara, [5] Vṛṣabha, [6] Vṛṣagarbha, [7] Vṛṣāṅka, [8] Vṛṣabhadhvaja, 

[0;33;40m1.47
[9] Vṛṣaja, and [10] Vṛṣanandana: these are to be known properly as the ten leaders in Vāyu's region [in the north-west], as I taught them, O twice-born. 

[0;33;40m1.48
[1] Sulabha, [2] Sumana, [3] Saumya, [4] Supraja, [5] Sutanu, [6] Śiva, [7] Sata, [8] Satya, [9] Laya, [10] Śambhu: [these are] the ten leaders in the north. 

[0;33;40m1.49
[1] Indu, [2] Bindu, [3] Bhuva, [4] Vajra, [5] Varada, [6] Vara, [7] Varṣaṇa, [8] Ilana, [9] Valina, [10] Brahmā: [these are] the ten rulers in the Īśāna direction [i.e. in the north-east]. 

[0;33;40m1.50
[1] Apara, [2] Vimala, [3] Moha, [4] Nirmala, [5] Mana, [6] Mohana, [7] Akṣaya, [8] Avyaya, [9] Viṣṇu, [10] Varada: [these are] the ten [leaders] in the centre. 

[0;33;40m1.51
Each of the ten rulers has a retinue of a hundred subordinates. Each one of [these] hundred is surrounded by a thousand subordinates. 

[0;33;40m1.52
Each one of the thousand is surrounded by ten thousand [subordinates], the ten thousand is surrounded by a multitude of a hundred thousand, the hundred thousand by a million, 

[0;33;40m1.53
[that is] each one has a retinue of a million (Łniyuta$) [subordinates]. [Then those] are surrounded by ten million (Łkoṭi$) [subordinates], [they in turn] by a hundred million (Łdaśakoṭi$). 

[0;33;40m1.54
Each one of the hundred million is surrounded by a billion (Łvṛnda$) subordinates (Łbhṛta$). Each one in these groups of a billion (Łvṛnda$) is surrounded by ten billion (Łkharva$) [subordinates]. 

[0;33;40m1.55
Each in these groups of ten billion (Łkharva$) is surrounded by a hundred billion (Łdaśakharva$). Each of those hundred billion is surrounded by a trillion (Łśaṅku$) [deities]. 

[0;33;40m1.56
Each of those one trillion is surrounded by ten trillion (Łpadma$). Each of those ten trillion is surrounded by a hundred trillion (Łsamudra$). 

[0;33;40m1.57
And each of those hundred trillion is surrounded by those whose number is one quadrillion (Łmadhya$). Each of those quadrillion is surrounded by ten quadrillion (Łananta$). 

[0;33;40m1.58
Each of those ten quadrillion is surrounded by a hundred quadrillion (Łparārdha$). Each of those hundred quadrillion is surrounded by two hundred quadrillion (Łpara$). This is how it is taught, O Brahmin. The enumeration [of the rulers of the Brahmāṇḍa] has been taught as much as it is possible. 




[--- Measurements ---]

[0;33;40m1.59
Listen to me and learn about the measurements [of the universe, or Brahmā's Egg], O Brahmin, I shall teach [you] in a concise manner. The body of the Egg is like that of [the moon] at moonrise on the day of the full moon. 

[0;33;40m1.60
The whole circumference of the Egg has been declared by Brahmā to be ten million (Łkoṭi$) times a thousand times ten million Łyojana$s. 

[0;33;40m1.61
The Sun shines from the height of seven thousand seven hundred and twenty Łkoṭi$ finger's breath. 

[0;33;40m1.62
The numbers pertaining to the measurements have been taught in brief. The characteristics of the unmeasurable Brahmāṇḍa[s] have been taught. 




[--- The redactors (of the Purāṇas) ---]

[0;33;40m1.63
O truest of the twice-born, the Purāṇa[s of] 8,000,000 [verses] were taught by [1] Brahmā to [2] Mātariśvan [= Vāyu] in their entirety, in their true form. 

[0;33;40m1.64
Vāyu abridged the verses and then gave [the Purāṇas] to [3] Uśanas. He [Uśanas] also abridged the verses, and [4] Bṛhaspati received them. 

[0;33;40m1.65
Bṛhaspati taught 30,000 [verses] to [5] Sūrya [the Sun]. Divākara [= the Sun] taught 25,000 [verses] to [6] Mṛtyu [Death]. 

[0;33;40m1.66
Mṛtyu taught 21,000 [verses] to [7] Indra. Indra taught 20,000 verses to [8] Vasiṣṭha. 

[0;33;40m1.67
And he[, Vasiṣṭha taught] 18,000 [verses] to [9] Sārasvata. Sārasvata [taught] 17,000 [verses] to [10] Tridhāma[n]. 

[0;33;40m1.68
[He taught] 16,000 verses to [11] Bharadvāja. [Bharadvāja] taught 15,000 verses to [12] Trivṛṣa. 

[0;33;40m1.69
[Trivṛṣa] then [taught] 14,000 verses to [13] Antarīkṣa. [Antarīkṣa] taught 13,000 [verses] to [14] Trayyāruṇi. 

[0;33;40m1.70
Trayyāruṇi, the great Brahmin, having abridged them again, taught 12,000 [verses] to [15] Dhanaṃjaya. 

[0;33;40m1.71
Dhanaṃjaya, the great sage, handed [them] over to [16] Kṛtaṃjaya. [That recension was transmitted] from Kṛtaṃjaya, O best of the twice-born, to [17] noble Ṛṇaṃjaya. 

[0;33;40m1.72
Then from Ṛṇaṃjaya it was given to [18] Gautama, the great sage, from Gautama to [19] Bharadvāja, from him to [20] Haryātman. 

[0;33;40m1.73
Then [21] Rājaśravas received it, then [22] Somaśuṣma. Then from Somaśuṣma [23] Tṛṇabindu received it, O twice-born. 

[0;33;40m1.74
Tṛṇabindu taught it to [24] Vṛkṣa, Vṛkṣa to [25] Śakti [the father of Parāśara]. Śakti taught it to [26] Parāśara, then [Parāśara] to [27] Jatukarṇa. 

[0;33;40m1.75
Jatukarṇa taught it to [28] [Vyāsa] Dvaipāyana, the great sage. Dvaipāyana, the great sage, gave it to [29] Romaharṣa. 

[0;33;40m1.76
Romaharṣa taught the Purāṇa[s] of 12,000 [verses], now fully revealed, to his son, [30] Amitabuddhi, for the benefit of humankind. What else do you wish to know? 

Here ends the first chapter in the ŁVṛṣasārasaṃgraha$ called the Description of the Brahmāṇḍa[s].





------ CHAPTER TWO ------

[0;33;40m2.1
Vigatarāga spoke: I have heard the description of the Brahmāṇḍa with [your help,] the best of men, its extent, colour, form and the numbers associated with it, in a concise manner. 

[0;33;40m2.2
You mentioned a Śivāṇḍa as taught to be the receptacle of the Brahmāṇḍa. What are its characteristics and how much is its extent? 

[0;33;40m2.3
Whose dwelling place is it? And [what] is the scale of the one[s] who dwell there? What kind of people live there? And who is the ruler (Łprajāpati$) there? 




[--- Summary of the Śivāṇḍa ---]

[0;33;40m2.4
Anarthayajña spoke: Please don't ask me about the characteristics of the Śivāṇḍa, O Brahmin. How could even the gods have the power to really know and see [the Śivāṇḍa]? 

[0;33;40m2.5
The path leading to it is not to be trodden, it is more secret than any secret, and it is lofty. There is no master or servant there, nobody to be punished and no punisher. 

[0;33;40m2.6
There are no truthful or untruthful people there, no moral or immoral people, no crooked people, no hypocrisy, no thirst or envy. 

[0;33;40m2.7
There is no anger or greed there, no arrogance or discontent (Ł[a]sūyaka$), no envy or hatred, no cheaters and no jealousy. 

[0;33;40m2.8
There is no disease, no aging, no grief and no agitation there, there are no inferior or superior people and there is nobody in-between. 

[0;33;40m2.9
There are no privileged men or women there in Śiva's abode, no reproach or praise, no selfish or treacherous people. 

[0;33;40m2.10
There is no pride or arrogance there, no cruelty or trickery and so on. There are no beggars and no donors there. 

[0;33;40m2.11
Go without material desires (Łanarthin$), being there you'll be resting under a wishing tree. There is no karma there and no enemy. No Kali age is there and there is no fighting. 

[0;33;40m2.12
There is no Dvāpara age or Tretā or Kṛta. There are no Łmanvantara$s there and no Łkalpa$s. 

[0;33;40m2.13
No universal floods of destruction come, and there are no days and nights of Brahmā. There is no birth and death there and one never encounters catastrophes. 

[0;33;40m2.14
Nobody is tied to the noose of hope and there is no passion or delusion. There are no gods and demons there and no Yakṣas, Serpents and Rākṣasas. 

[0;33;40m2.15
There are neither Ghosts nor Piśācas, no Gandharvas and no Ṛṣis. There are no planets there, no Nāgas, Kiṃnaras or Garuḍa-like creatures. 

[0;33;40m2.16
There are no recitations or daily rituals there, nobody performs the Agnihotra and there are no sacrificers. There are no religious observances and no austerities and no `animal hell'. 

[0;33;40m2.17
Nobody would be able to tell the extent of the qualities of the god Īśāna's powers, not even in a hundred years. 

[0;33;40m2.18
All are born by Hara's wish. I shall teach [them to] you one by one, gods and people, and trees, bushes, creepers, etc. 

[0;33;40m2.19
The height [of the Śivāṇḍa] is two Łparārdha$s, and [its] width is the same. There are lovely flowers of different forms [there] and also lovely fruits. 

[0;33;40m2.20
There are also golden trees and also gem trees, coral gem thickets and ruby plants. 

[0;33;40m2.21
There are tasty roots and fruits and trees with creepers on their twigs. All are shape-shifters and they fulfill man's desires and they whisper seductively. 

[0;33;40m2.22
There [in the Śivāṇḍa], O Brahmin, all the subjects are the oceans of endless virtues. They are all equally beautiful and strong, and they shine like millions of suns. 

[0;33;40m2.23
[The Śivāṇḍa] is two Łparārdha$ long and two Łparārdha$ wide, and two Łparārdha$s is its [vertical] extension, [measured] in Łyojana$s, O great Brahmin. 

[0;33;40m2.24
[Īśāna's] powers cannot be expressed by numbers, neither can [His] powerfulness, O twice-born. [In fact, the distances in the Śivāṇḍa] downwards and upwards cannot be expressed by numbers. Nobody can traverse it horizontally. 

[0;33;40m2.25
[In reality,] I do not know the length and width of the Śivāṇḍa. Enjoyment is undecaying there, and there is no birth or death there. 

[0;33;40m2.26
In the centre of the Śivāṇḍa, [creatures] shine like cow's milk. [It is] said to be the region (Łālaya$) of the one and a half Łpara$ crore Īśānas. 

[0;33;40m2.27
They are all like the rising sun in the region of Tatpuruṣa. They are one and a half Łpara$ crore [in number], living in the east. 

[0;33;40m2.28
Everybody is like collyrium in the southern direction, in the region of Aghora, one and a half Łpara$ crore [in number]. 

[0;33;40m2.29
In the western direction, they are like jasmine, the moon, like snowy rocks. Sadyojāta's lovely region is [home] to one and a half Łpara$ crore [people]. 

[0;33;40m2.30
In the northern direction, they are like saffron in water. Vāmadeva's region is [home] to one and a half Łpara$ crore [people]. 

[0;33;40m2.31
Īśāna has five parts (Łkalā$), [his Tatpuruṣa] face has four. Aghora has eight, and there are thirteen Vāmadeva[-Łkalā$]s. 

[0;33;40m2.32
Sadyojāta has eight parts. These parts, altogether thirty-eight, which liberate us from the ocean of existence, have been taught, O truest Brahmin. 

[0;33;40m2.33
Those who explore the truth should know the numbers, the colours and directions associated with each one [of Śiva's faces] in the way taught above. 

[0;33;40m2.34
If one has the intention to go to the Śivāṇḍa, one should practise Śiva-yoga regularly. Without Śiva-yoga, O Brahmin, it is impossible to go there. 

[0;33;40m2.35
[Even] by [performing] millions of sacrifices such as the Aśvamedha, or by performing all the difficult austerities for a hundred Łkalpa$s, it is impossible to get there even for the gods, O great ascetic. 

[0;33;40m2.36
By [merely] bathing and performing austerities at all the sacred places such as the Gaṅgā, even the honorable Ṛṣis will not be able to get there. 

[0;33;40m2.37
Or [even] by donating the oceans of the seven islands with all their gems to a Veda expert, O Brahmin, with faith and devotion, one will not be able to go there without meditation. [This is a] certainty. 

[0;33;40m2.38
He who destroys his own body and gives it without hesitation to those who are in need of it, or he who gives away his wife, his son and his possessions or his own head to those in need, or he who [performs] other difficult deeds, will not be able to go there [by merely doing these]. 

[0;33;40m2.39
He who has completed the sacrifices, the pilgrimages, the austerities, the donations, the study of the Vedas, will experience those enjoyments that the Brahmāṇḍa offers, still being subject to time and death. 

[0;33;40m2.40
Dharma decays tossed forward by time. Time flies moving everything round and round like a circle of burning coal. Time is called Łkāla$ because of the waves (Łkalana$) of the three divisions of time [past, present, future]. 

Here ends the second chapter in the ŁVṛṣasārasaṃgraha$ called the Description of the Śivāṇḍa.





------ CHAPTER THREE ------




[--- An Exposition of Dharma ---]

[0;33;40m3.1
Vigatarāga spoke: Why do they call it Dharma? And how many embodiments (Łmūrti$) is he known to have? He is known as a bull: how many legs does it have? How many are his paths? 

[0;33;40m3.2
I have become curious [about these questions]. Put an end to my doubts for good. Whose son is [Dharma], O best of sages? How many children does he have? 

[0;33;40m3.3
Anarthayajña spoke: Well, Łdhṛti$ (`firmness') is [of the same] verbal root [as Łdharma$], and is said to be [its] synonym. It is called Łdharma$ because it supports (ŁāDHĀRaṇa$) and because it is great (ŁMAhattva$). 

[0;33;40m3.4
The four-legged Bull is the embodiment of both Śruti and Smṛti. It is Dharma, as made up of the four Łāśrama$s. 

[0;33;40m3.5
And the paths of Dharma are five. Listen, O Brahmin: [existence as] gods, men, animals, [existence in] hell and [as] immovable things [such as plants and rocks] etc. 

[0;33;40m3.6
Eternal Dharma was born after splitting Brahmā's heart. He has beautiful wives, thirteen in number, with nice waists. 

[0;33;40m3.7
They are Dakṣa's daughters, [called] Śraddhā and so on. They have huge eyes and they are beautiful. Numerous sons and grandsons were born to him. This is the nature of Dharma. What more do you wish to hear? 

[0;33;40m3.8
Vigatarāga spoke: I would like to hear about Dharma's wives truly and about each one of the sons born to them. Teach me, O great ascetic. 

[0;33;40m3.9
Anarthayajña spoke: [Dharma's wives are] [1] Śraddhā (`Faith'), [2] Lakṣmī (`Prosperity'), [3] Dhṛti (`Resolution'), [4] Tuṣṭi (`Satisfaction'), [5] Puṣṭi (`Growth'), [6] Medhā (`Wisdom'), [7] Kriyā (`Labour'), [8] Lajjā (`Modesty'), [9] Buddhi (`Intelligence'), [10] Śānti (`Tranquillity'), [11] Vapus (`Beauty'), [12] Kīrti (`Fame'), [13] Siddhi (`Success'), [all] born to Prasūti [Dakṣa's wife]. 

[0;33;40m3.10
Śraddhā's son is Kāma (`Desire'). Darpa (`Pride') is said to be Lakṣmī's son. Dhṛti's son is Niyama (`Rule'). Saṃtoṣa (`Satisfaction') is Tuṣṭi's son. 

[0;33;40m3.11
To Puṣṭi was born a son [called] Lābha (`Profit'). Medhā's son is Śruta (`Sacred Knowledge'). Kriyā's sons are Daṇḍa (`Punishment') and Samaya (`Law'). 

[0;33;40m3.12
Lajjā's son is Vinaya (`Discipline'), Buddhi's son is Bodha (`Intelligence'). Lajjā has two [more] sons: Sudhiya[/Sudhī] (`Wise') and Apramāda (`Cautiousness'). 

[0;33;40m3.13
Kṣema (`Peace') is to be known as Śānti's son, Vyavasāya (`Resolution') is Vapus' son. Yaśas (`Fame') is Kīrti's son, Sukha (`Joy') was born to Siddhi. [This is how] the sons of Dharma in the [Łmanvantara$] era of Svāyambhuva [Manu] were known. 

[0;33;40m3.14
Vigatarāga spoke: How come Dharma has two embodiments? Tell me, O great ascetic. I am extremely intrigued. Cut my doubts concerning [this] knowledge. 

[0;33;40m3.15
Anarthayajña spoke: Dharma's embodiment is said to consist of Śruti and Smṛti. The characteristics of the Śrauta [tradition] are an association with a wife [i.e. marriage] and with the fire ritual, and sacrifice. The Smārta [tradition] [focuses on] the conduct (Łācāra$) of the classes (Łvarṇa$) and life-stages (Łāśrama$) which is connected to rules and regulations (Łyama-niyama$). 




[--- Yama and Niyama rules ---]

[0;33;40m3.16
Now hear the classification of both the Łyama$ and Łniyama$ rules. Non-violence, truthfulness, not stealing, absence of hostility, self-restraint, taboos, virtue, carefulness, charm, honesty: these are the ten Łyama$s. 

[0;33;40m3.17
The wise say that there are five subclasses to each. I shall teach you about non-violence and the other [Łyama$-rules]. Listen carefully, O twice-born. 




[--- The first Yama-rule: Non-violence ---]

[0;33;40m3.18
Frightening and beating [other people], tying [someone] up, killing and the destruction of [other people's] livelihood: violence is said by the wise who see the truth to be of [these] five types. 

[0;33;40m3.19
Cruel people beat [other people] with sticks, clods of earth [understand: they stone them], with whips and other [objects] in the everyday world. Their bodies broken by the same blows, they receive the capital punishment. 

[0;33;40m3.20
[Others,] tie up [people] at their feet and their arms and chests. [These,] hung by their hair and neck, die in this way without being wounded. This is the capital punishment for tying up [other people]. 

[0;33;40m3.21
He who frightens [other people] with the terrible danger of enemies and thieves, with lions, tigers, elephants or snakes, or by other horrors, will be executed. 

[0;33;40m3.22
He who robs somebody's money is to be punished by the same person. He is [to be] struck down by those whose livelihood got damaged by him. 

[0;33;40m3.23
[Those who kill other people] with poison, fire, arrows, swords, or by the force of magic or yoga, are called murderers by the sages who see the truth, O great Brahmin. 

[0;33;40m3.24
Non-violence is the highest Dharma. He who abandons it is a wicked person. It is free of pain and trouble, it yields the fruits of all [other] Dharmic teachings [in itself]. 

[0;33;40m3.25
There isn't a bigger fool than he [who abandons it]. There is no bigger mental darkness [than the abandonment of non-violence]. There is no greater suffering or greater infamy. 

[0;33;40m3.26
There is no greater sin or a more effective poison. There is no greater ignorance, there is nothing worse, O great ascetic. 

[0;33;40m3.27
He who does not harm the four types of living beings beginning with plants is the best person, having compassion for all creatures. 

[0;33;40m3.28
He who always has compassion for all creatures is the [true] Pandit. He is the [true] sacrificer, the [true] ascetic, he is the donor, the one with a firm vow. 

[0;33;40m3.29
Non-violence is the supreme pilgrimage place. Non-violence is the highest austerity. Non-violence is the highest donation. Non-violence is the highest joy. 

[0;33;40m3.30
Non-violence is the supreme sacrifice. Non-violence is the supreme religious observance. Non-violence is supreme knowledge. Non-violence is the supreme ritual. 

[0;33;40m3.31
Non-violence is the highest purity. Non-violence is the highest self-restraint. Non-violence is the highest profit. Non-violence is the greatest fame. 

[0;33;40m3.32
Non-violence is the supreme Dharma. Non-violence is the supreme path. Non-violence is the supreme Brahman. Non-violence is supreme Śiva. 

[0;33;40m3.33
One should refrain from meat-consumption. One should not even desire it mentally. He who abandons meat will receive a great reward. 

[0;33;40m3.34
He who wishes to nourish his own flesh with the flesh of other [beings], outside of worshipping the ancestors and the gods, is the biggest sinner of all. 

[0;33;40m3.35
During the Łmadhuparka$ offering and during a sacrifice, during rituals for the ancestors and the gods: only in these cases are animals to be slaughtered and not in any other case. [This is what] Manu taught. 

[0;33;40m3.36
Should he buy it or procure it himself or should it be offered by others, if he eats meat, he will not sin if he first worships the gods and the ancestors. 

[0;33;40m3.37
[People who perform] Vedic sacrifices and austerities, and [visit] sacred places, donate, [those who are of] good conduct, [perform] rituals and [keep] religious vows, [but eat meat] will not [be able to] enjoy even a tiny portion of [such rewards that] [those] people [receive] who have given up meat. 

[0;33;40m3.38
Deer and goats, sheep, cows and other [animals] wander in the world happily and in great strength [just] from eating leaves and grass. 

[0;33;40m3.39
Monkeys eat fruits, Rākṣasas prefer blood. The fruit-eating monkeys defeated all the Rākṣasas. 

[0;33;40m3.40
Therefore one should not crave meat in the hope of gaining strength, O Brahmin, in order to be able to draw a bow with force, or out of fear of the danger coming from the enemy. 

[0;33;40m3.41
By wishing to make donations and perform sacrifices no one will become comparable to someone who refrains from violence. [He will have] fame and glory in this world and the supreme path in the other. 

[0;33;40m3.42
A person who refrains from violence will gain, no doubt about it, the [same] meritorious rewards that others would get by donating the three worlds filled with jewels and gems in their entirety to an excellent Brahmin, by [performing] a thousand [times] ten trillion (Łpadma$) [times] ten thousand (Łayuta$) Łkoṭīyajña$ sacrifices, by donating the earth [to a priest] as sacrificial fee, and by bathing [at] a thousand times ten million times a million (Łniyuta$) sacred places at once. 

Here ends the third chapter in the ŁVṛṣasārasaṃgraha$ called the Praise of Non-violence.





------ CHAPTER FOUR ------




[--- The second Yama-rule: Truthfulness ---]

[0;33;40m4.1
Anarthayajña spoke: The state of being real (Łsad-bhāva$) is called truth (Łsat-ya$). Alternatively, it is also a certainty (Łpratyaya$) that originates in perception (Łdṛṣṭa$). Relating things in a way that corresponds to reality is called `speaking the truth.' 

[0;33;40m4.2
He who endures severe abuse and beating etc. but keeps quiet, his self being conquered, is said to be [an example of] truth[fulness]. 

[0;33;40m4.3
If one is being interrogated at any time with a sword lifted to strike him down, in this case the truth is not to be spoken, and a lie is can be called truth. 

[0;33;40m4.4
A person who is walking on the road and is afraid of being killed verify should not reply [to people who are potentially dangerous] even if they ask him. This is also called truth[fulness]. 

[0;33;40m4.5
A lie does not hurt when it is connected with joking, with women, O king, at the time of marriage, at the departure from life and when one's entire wealth is about to be taken away. They call these five kinds of lies truths. 

[0;33;40m4.6
Since truth is the supreme Dharma in [the world of] gods, humans and animals, truth is the best, the most preferable. Truth is the eternal Dharma. 

[0;33;40m4.7
Truth is an unmanifest ocean. Truth yields imperishable pleasures. Truth is the ship that carries you to the other world. Truth is the wide path. 

[0;33;40m4.8
Truth is said to be the desired path. Truth is the supreme sacrifice. Truth is a pilgrimage place, a supreme pilgrimage place. Truth is an endless donation. 

[0;33;40m4.9
Truth is morality, austerity, knowledge. Truth is purity, self-control and tranquillity. Truth is the ladder upwards. Truth is fame and glory and happiness. 

[0;33;40m4.10
[When] a thousand Aśvamedha sacrifices and truth are measured on a pair of scales, truth indeed surpasses a thousand Aśvamedha sacrifices. 

[0;33;40m4.11
The Sun shines because of truth. The Earth stays in place by truth. The winds blow because of truth. Water is cooling through truth. 

[0;33;40m4.12
The oceans exist by the truthful encounter with Priyavrata. Govinda abides in truth because He [as Vāmana] stopped [Mahā]Bali [in spite of the fact that this was achieved by a trick]. 

[0;33;40m4.13
Fire burns according to truth. The Moon's course is [governed] by truth. It is because of truth that the Vindhya mountain stands in place and that although it was growing, it is not growing [anymore]. 

[0;33;40m4.14
The [mythical] Lokāloka mountains are located in truth. Mount Meru stands by truth. The Vedas abide in truth. Dharma is rooted in truth. 

[0;33;40m4.15
The milk a cow yields is truth. Ghee in milk is present as truth. The soul dwells in the body in truth. The eternal soul is truth. 

[0;33;40m4.16
If truth is obtained by somebody (Łekena$), he/she will be one for whom Dharma is surely accomplished. By the heroism of Rāma Rāghava, the only truth was well-guarded. 

[0;33;40m4.17
Thus have [I] taught the rules of truth to you, O virtuous one, to favour the whole world. What else do you wish to hear? 




[--- The third Yama-rule: Refraining from stealing ---]

[0;33;40m4.18
Vigatarāga spoke: I can't have enough of learning about [this teaching of] your[s on] Dharma. Teach me further than this, O great ascetic. 

[0;33;40m4.19
Anarthayajña spoke: Now listen to [my teaching about] stealing, O great Brahmin, which is taught to be of five kinds. Firstly, [listen to] theft, then bribery, cheating with weights, cheating with scales, and the fifth kind, robbery. 

[0;33;40m4.20
When somebody's wealth is taken away by an impudent and wicked person is called theft. It is a foolish thought even if suppressed. 

[0;33;40m4.21
O great Brahmin, listen to bribery, which defiles Dharma. A sum of money taken in order to exempt somebody from a duty is a bribe. Therefore this [also] should be considered as such [i.e. as stealing because] it is committed out of greed for material goods. 

[0;33;40m4.22
[Even if] somebody wants to protect a family by the method of cheating with weights, that person should be considered a thief, because he takes away other people's wealth. 

[0;33;40m4.23
[The case is similar] if somebody takes away somebody else's belongings by the method of cheating with scales. Other people, deceitful swindlers (Łkūṭa-kāpaṭika$) share the characteristics of thieves. 

[0;33;40m4.24
If someone, by deceit or by force, snatches away the wealth of weak and honest people and simpletons, that morally corrupt usurper is [simply] a thief. 

[0;33;40m4.25
There is no sin equal to stealing. There is no crime (Ładharma$) equal to it. There is no ill-fame comparable to that of being a thief. There is no bad-conduct comparable to being a thief. 

[0;33;40m4.26
There is no greater ignorance than stealing. There are no bigger rouges than thieves. There is nobody as ignorant as a thief. There is not a lazy person who is comparable to a thief. 

[0;33;40m4.27
There is nobody as detestable as a thief. There is nobody disliked as much as a thief. There is no greater suffering than stealing. There is no greater disgrace than theft. 

[0;33;40m4.28
Some [thieves] take away [other people's] wealth in disguise, some in broad daylight. Other wicked people take money from deposits, and some people steal through fraud. Some gather wealth by forging documents, others steal from stolen money[?]. Some people's wealth is from purchased [children?] (Łkrīta$). Others take away others' inheritance[?]. These are considered the vilest. 

[0;33;40m4.29
There isn't a bigger idiot than a thief, who is a wicked person without Dharma and Artha. As long as he lives, he trembles in fear of the king, wailing. Having received his punishment, he gets into severe and [in]tolerable difficulties, propelled by [his] karma. When his time comes, he dies and goes to hell, weeping vehemently. 

[0;33;40m4.30
Having spent ten million ae ons of suffering, they emerge from hell to the state of animal existence. Thus, they roam about in animal existence for a hundred and one times ten million years. Then they reach the status of human existence on earth which is full of poverty and disease. Then abandoning all one's karmas, the causes of suffering, one seeks refuge in Śiva. 




[--- The fourth Yama-rule: Absence of hostility ---]

[0;33;40m4.31
The one who is hostile towards the eight-formed Śiva, he who hurts his mother or father, he who is hostile towards cows or guests: these are the five types of cruel people. 

[0;33;40m4.32
Śiva in his manifest form (Łsākṣāt$) is of eight forms, with the five elements (Łvyoman$), the Sun, the Moon, and the sacrificer. [He who] disgraces [any of these] is a hostile person. 

[0;33;40m4.33
The father is to be considered similar to the [element] sky, he is the cause of one's birth. One should not be hostile to the forefathers, godsdots[?]. 

[0;33;40m4.34
The mother is more venerable than the earth. Who would not praise a mother? By that [praise], sacrifices, donations, austerities and [the study of] the Vedas, all will be completed. 

[0;33;40m4.35
Cows are an auspicious blessing, they are the gods of the gods. Cows contain in themselves all the gods. That is exactly why one should not hurt them. 

[0;33;40m4.36
Cows are the protectors of the world as if the world were their new-born [calf], there is no doubt about it. Collecting [the five products of the cow, the Łpañcagavya$,] ghee, milk, curd, and [the cow's] urine and dung [is auspicious]. 

[0;33;40m4.37
People who drink the five products of the cow, the five nectars, purified by the five Pavitras, will obtain the fruits of a horse sacrifice, and then reach the undecaying heavens. 

[0;33;40m4.38
There is no wealth comparable to [having] a cow. They yield milk, they draw [a plough etc.], they roam under the sky. Feeding on grass, they issue nectar. When given to Brahmins, they deliver the family [from Łsaṃsāra$ or the suffering experienced in hell]. 

[0;33;40m4.39
He who never fails to serve the cow daily [e.g. with a handful of grass], he who tends to the cows' service, he who is kind to her [i.e. to the cow], will obtain the merits of all sacrifices, austerities and donation. 

[0;33;40m4.40
One who looks after a guest, one who respects a guest, one who worships a guest, one who praises a guest, 

[0;33;40m4.41
one who does not harm a guest, one who does not commit a fault towards a guest, one who keeps the guest happy, one who attends to the needs of a guest, one who makes a guest satisfied: his merits are endless. 

[0;33;40m4.42
He should offer [the guest] a seat, a vessel with water-offering, and water for washing his feet, or gifts of food and clothes, or all [of these]. 

[0;33;40m4.43
He who worships the guest by [offering him] his own son, wife or himself with willingness, without hesitation, and with a brave heart, 

[0;33;40m4.44
and does not ask [the guests about their] lineage, Vedic affiliation (Łcaraṇa$), studies, country or birth, and imagines mentally, with devotion, that it is Dharma himself who has arrived, 

[0;33;40m4.45
[will obtain all the fruits of] thousands of Aśvamedha sacrifices and hundreds of Rājasūya sacrifices, a thousand Puṇḍarīka sacrifices and the fruit of [visiting] all the pilgrimage places and [performing] all the austerities; 

[0;33;40m4.46
he whose guest is satisfied [and] he who can abandon the sentiment of cruelty, will obtain all the merits of the above, there is no doubt about it. 

[0;33;40m4.47
dots will ever reach the path. Therefore one should go up to the arriving guest with respectfully joined palms. 

[0;33;40m4.48
By one Łprastha$ [a small unit of weight] of coarsely ground grains given to a guest, an extremely wonderful sacrifice was performed [so to say], and his body [i.e. the protagonist in his mortal form] reached heaven. 

[0;33;40m4.49
The mongoose related [this story in the ŁMahābhārata$] in the past in detail, O great Brahmin, and you known it already. The story of the Łprastha$ is well-known. 




[--- The fifth Yama-rule: Self-restraint ---]

[0;33;40m4.50
Self-restraint is in itself the collected essence of Dharma for humans. Self-restraint is Dharma, self-restraint is heaven, self-restraint is fame, self-restraint is happiness. 

[0;33;40m4.51
Self-restraint is sacrifice, self-restraint is a pilgrimage-place, self-restraint is merit, self-restraint is religious austerity. If one has no self-restraint, one is a sinner (Ładharma$), [while] self-restraint yields a multitude of desired objects. 

[0;33;40m4.52
The elephant, the fish, the moth, the bee and the deer are without self-restraint. The senses are the skin, the tongue, the nose, the eye and the ear. 

[0;33;40m4.53
Each of these sense faculties are hard to conquer and all are known to be fatal [if unconquered]. If one masters self-restraint in a less than proper way, one remains unrestrained and will die . 

[0;33;40m4.54
In the case of the deer, death comes about because of hearing [when, e.g., hunters use buck grunts]. Moths die because of their eyes [as they are attracted to the light of a lamp]. Bees perish because of their smelling [as they are attracted to smells], fish because of their tongues [when fishermen feed them]. 

[0;33;40m4.55
The elephant perishes because of touch, not tolerating to be kept in fetters. How much more true it is for those who enjoy all five [senses]! Why should death come as a surprise for them? 

[0;33;40m4.56
Purūravas [perished] by excessive greed, Daṇḍaka by excessive desire, Sagara's sons by excessive pride, Rāvaṇa by excessive haughtiness, 

[0;33;40m4.57
Saudāsa by excessive anger, the Yādavas by excessive drinking, Māndhātṛ by excessive desire, Nahuṣa by contempt for Brahmins, 

[0;33;40m4.58
[Mahā]bali perished by excessive donations, Arjuna by excessive heroism, King Nala by excessive gambling, Nṛga by taking a cow. 

[0;33;40m4.59
[For] a person who is without self-restraint, O great Brahmin, there is no heaven, liberation or happiness. O Brahmin, people without self-restraint are the destruction of knowledge, Dharma, family and fame. 




[--- The sixth Yama-rule: Taboos ---]

[0;33;40m4.60
A person without taboos does not exists either in this or the other world. In a person without taboos there is no Dharma or religious austerity. 

[0;33;40m4.61
These five should be treated as taboo: women who are not depending on oneself, others' wealth, taking away others' lives, hurting others and [consuming] others' food. 

[0;33;40m4.62
Listen, O great Brahmin, the wise should always treat women who are not dependent on oneself as taboo, [be she] a queen, a Brahmin's wife, a wandering religious mendicant, a relative or of another caste. 

[0;33;40m4.63
Listen further to something else, with regards to others' wealth. [It may include] gaining wealth through unlawful means, when somebody takes away other people's wealth by cheating with weights of one Łāḍha[ka]$ or a Łprastha$ and with scales. 

[0;33;40m4.64
O Brahmin, the wise should regard the taking away [of others'] lives as taboo. Wild and domesticated animals, serpents, [in general,] plants and animals [are examples of life forms not to destroy]. 

[0;33;40m4.65
And what is the hurting of others? Listen, O Brahmin, I'll tell you briefly. He who is hostile to the gods, Brahmins, gurus, mothers and guests [hurts others]. 

[0;33;40m4.66
As regards other people's food, eating together with people whose food is not to be accepted (Łabhojyeṣu$) is taboo, [e.g.] after birth or death [in a family], in case of vendors of alcohol, or a family having lost their caste, and in the case of a [member of the] Naṭa [caste of dancers]. 

[0;33;40m4.67
Those people who stick to the five kinds of taboo [and thus] seek heaven, wealth and liberation, will reach eternal faultlessness in this world, embellished with fame and glory. [A person like that] will obtain wisdom, intelligence, [knowledge of] the Śruti and Smṛti traditions, and honour forever. Kindness will arise and he will obtain an extra long life, no doubt. 




[--- The seventh Yama-rule: The five methods of virtue? ---]

[0;33;40m4.68
The four cases of observing silence, [victory over] the four enemies, the four sanctuariess, the four meditations, and the four legged [Dharma] are called the five ways of being virtuous. 

[0;33;40m4.69
I shall tell you about the four cases of observing silence. Listen, be attentive. One should avoid violent and slanderous [words], lies, and idle [talk]. 

[0;33;40m4.70
The fourfold enemy [made up of] desire, anger, greed and delusion is to be destroyed. He who destroys [these] enemies will become sinless. 

[0;33;40m4.71
I shall teach you the four sanctuaries. Listen, O Brahmin. Compassion, sympathy in joy, indifference, and benevolence are the four sanctuaries. 

[0;33;40m4.72
I shall now teach you the four meditations, which will liberate you from transmigration. Meditation is taught to be fourfold: of the Self, Łvidyā$, Łbhava$ [= Śiva] and the subtle one (Łsūkṣma$). 

[0;33;40m4.73
The Łtattva$ of the Self is Dharma. ŁVidyā$ is in the five in a fivefold way[??]. They call the thirty-sixth the imperishable one, [and] the subtle Łtattva$ has no attributes. 

[0;33;40m4.74
The four-legged one is said to be Dharma [as] it rests on the four Łāśrama$s, [those of] the householder, the chaste one, the forest-dweller and the mendicant. 

[0;33;40m4.75
Virtuous are those who know these thoroughly, O great Brahmin. [They will experience] the purification of all sins and the growth of merits. 

[0;33;40m4.76
One's life-span, fame and glory and happiness grow only through virtue (Łdhanya$). In a virtuous person piece, prosperity, tradition (Łsmṛti$) and intelligence will arise. 




[--- The eighth Yama-rule: Lack of negligence ---]

[0;33;40m4.77
There are five areas of negligence. I shall teach them to you, listen. Murdering a Brahmin, drinking alcohol, stealing, having sex with the guru's wife: they call these grievous sins. The fifth is when one is connected with them [i.e. with these sins or with people involved in these sinful acts]. 

[0;33;40m4.78
A lie concerning one's superiority, a slander that reaches the king's ear, and false accusations against an elder are equal to killing a Brahmin. 

[0;33;40m4.79
Abandoning the Vedas, reviling the Vedas, being a false witness, murdering a friend, eating unfit or forbidden food are six [deeds that are] equal to drinking alcohol. 

[0;33;40m4.80
Sexual intercourse with a female relative, with an unmarried girl, with women of the lowest castes, with the wife of a friend or of one's own son are said to be equal to violating the guru's bed. 

[0;33;40m4.81
Stealing deposits, people, horses, silver, land, diamonds, or gems are said to be equal to stealing gold. 

[0;33;40m4.82
If a man is associated with [any of these] four [i.e. Łbrahmahatyā, surāpāna, stena, gurvaṅganāgama$], he commits sin. By this all the five grievous sins have been explained. These five kinds of negligence are to be avoided, O great Brahmin. 




[--- The ninth Yama-rule: Charm ---]

[0;33;40m4.83
[Charm has five types:] bodily, verbal and mental charm, [charm of] the eyes and [of one's] thoughts as fifth. Giving [others] a friendly glance [is commendable] and one should avoid cruel thoughts. 

[0;33;40m4.84
One should meditate with a tranquil mind and should speak [to other people using] gentle words. [When] respectable people arrive at one's own hermitage, [one should] present them with as many gifts as one can, 

[0;33;40m4.85
with gifts of fire-wood, water and fire. [If] fire-wood, fire and water are easily available [but] are not given [as gift] or [if the phrase] `Live [for a hundred years]!' is not uttered when [somebody] sneezes, what reward could there be for such a person in the afterlife? 




[--- The tenth Yama-rule: Sincerity ---]

[0;33;40m4.86
The sages who see the truth praise five types of sincerity. A sincere person does not rejoice in prosperity arising from the operation of karma or by a reward, in riches from women, from property, and bribery. 

[0;33;40m4.87
If one is not sincere, sacrifice is in vain. If one is not sincere, austerity is in vain. If one is not sincere, donation is in vain. If one is not sincere, [sacrificial] fires are in vain. 

[0;33;40m4.88
The sense faculties of a sincere person are firm even when he is delighted. The gods are always present in the body of a sincere person. 

[0;33;40m4.89
Thus has been taught this section on the Łyama$-rules, O great Brahmin. Humans should follow them to reach happiness here and in the other world. One will stand removing one's filth of sins, and shall by Śaṅkara's command become a ruler of the world [that he subjugates] under one royal umbrella. 

Here ends the fourth chapter in the ŁVṛṣasārasaṃgraha$ called the Section on the Yama-rules.





------ CHAPTER FIVE ------




[--- The Niyama-rules ---]

[0;33;40m5.1
Vigatarāga spoke: Now teach me the true nature of the Niyama-rules in detail. I have become desirious to hear [your] teaching that is comparable to ambrosia. Tell me more (Łapara vada$), [to the one who had been] burnt by the fire of materiality (Łprakṛti$), [but is now] sprinkled with the water of knowledge, and is ignorant of [the topic]. One can't have enough of the [teaching on] Dharmas (Łnāsti dharmeṣu tṛptiḥ$). 

[0;33;40m5.2
Anarthayajña spoke: I shall teach you something more that is nice to hear, O best of the twice-born. The specific sections of the Niyamas are of five types [each]. It is the essence of Dharma, dear to Hari, Hara and the sages, O great Brahmin, the destruction of the impurity of the Kali age, generally known as liberation. 

[0;33;40m5.3
Purification, sacrifice, penance, donation, Vedic study and the restraint of sexual desire, religious observances, fasting, observing silence, and bathing: these are the ten Niyamas. 




[--- The first Niyama-rule: Purity ---]

[0;33;40m5.4
From among these, now I shall tell you the particulars of purification [first], and [then] the others. [1] Bodily purity, [2] [purity of] food, [3] [purity of] property[?] (Łmātrā$), [4] [purity of] character[?] (Łbhāva$), and the fifth, [5]...? 

[0;33;40m5.5
He should not beat, tie or kill [any living being]. [This and] purity concerning others' wives and property is called bodily purity. 

[0;33;40m5.6
The cleanliness of the ears, O great Brahmin, and of the anus, the loins, the mouth etc. [also contributes to bodily purity]. The purity of the mouth [comes from] sipping water before eating, speaking. 

[0;33;40m5.7
After the emission of urine and fae ces, and before the worship of gods, the wise one should clean his anus and his loins with clay and water. 

[0;33;40m5.8
One [portion of clay] for the loins, five for the anus, ten for one hand, [then] seven [portions] of clay are to be applied for both [hands] by him who wishes cleanliness. 

[0;33;40m5.9
This is the purification for the householder (Łgṛhastha$). It is twice as much for the chaste one (Łbrahmacārin$), three times as much for the forest-dweller (Łvānaprastha$), four times as much for the ascetic (Łyati$). 

[0;33;40m5.10
I shall teach you the rules of purity concerning food. Listen, pay great attention. One should eat [as much] food [that fills] two quarters [of the stomach] and drink water [that fills] one quarter. In order to give passage to the air, one should save the remaining quarter. 

[0;33;40m5.11
[By] the wise one['s applying] the six soft and sweet juices, [which are] the six flavours in food, the disturbances of the Łdhātu$s will disappear and the terrible illnesses will not arise. 

[0;33;40m5.12
He should not eat what is forbidden and he should not drink what is forbidden. He should not go where he is not allowed to and he should not say what is improper. 

[0;33;40m5.13
He should avoid garlic, onion, Łgṛñjana$ onion, mushrooms, buffalo meat and pork, following the rules. 

[0;33;40m5.14
He should not eat Łchattrāka$ mushrooms, village hog, and cow flesh. He should also avoid sparrows, pigeons, and water-birds. 

[0;33;40m5.15
He should also avoid [eating] geese, cranes, Łcakravāka$ birds, cocks, parrots and hawks, crows, owls, Łbalāka$ herons, fish etc. 

[0;33;40m5.16
He should avoid everything that is ritually impure or polluted. He should also completely avoid those vegetables, roots and fruits, that are prohibited. 

[0;33;40m5.17
In the books of Manu, in the Purāṇas, in Śaiva texts, and in the ŁBhāratasaṃhitā$ (i.e. the ŁMahābhārata$), the practice of purity is definitely expanded in great detail. Now you have asked me [about it], and I taught it [to you] in a condensed form. 

[0;33;40m5.18
He who speaks the truth is pure. He who engages in yogic meditation is pure. He who avoids violence and is restrained is pure. Compassion towards living beings and patience is purity. 

[0;33;40m5.19
Of all the [ways of] purification, material purification is taught to be the highest. For he who is pure with regards to material things is truly pure, and not the one who [only] uses clay and water [i.e. the one who performs only ordinary baths]. When purification pertains to the body, to speech and to the mind, he is pure in all respects. 

[0;33;40m5.20
If a person who knows the rules of purity and impurity is determined to destroy aging, he will surely gain attractiveness, eternally embellished with glory and fame. He has obtained here in this world all the merits that the books on true Dharma teach, and at the end of his life he will undoubtedly reach the desired path in the other world. 

Here ends the fifth chapter in the ŁVṛṣasārasaṃgraha$ called the Method of Purification.





------ CHAPTER SIX ------




[--- The second Niyama-rule: Sacrifice ---]

[0;33;40m6.1
[Anarthayajña continued:] Now I shall teach you the five types of sacrifice (Łijyā$), O excellent Brahmin, for success in Dharma and liberation. Listen carefully, O Brahmin. 

[0;33;40m6.2
Material sacrifice, sacrifice through work, sacrifice through recitation, knowledge and meditation: I shall teach you these five one by one. 

[0;33;40m6.3
Material sacrifice includes the following: the domestic ritual fire worship etc., the public performance of the ritual of Agnihotra, [and the so-called Łpākayajña$s such as] the Aṣṭakā oblation, the Pārvaṇī oblation, and the ancestral ritual (Łśrāddha$). 

[0;33;40m6.4
Sacrifice through work is taking care of/ cleaning/ embellishing (Łsaṃskāra$) a grove, a park, a pond or a temple with one's own hands. 

[0;33;40m6.5
Next I shall teach you the sacrifice through recitation, the bestower of the fruits of heaven and liberation. One should recite the Vedas, Śaiva texts or the ŁMahābhārata$, the epics and the Purāṇas: this is called sacrifice with recitation. 

[0;33;40m6.6
[He who can decide if] `this is [proper] action; the other is improper action' because he is knowledgeable about reasoning pro and contra, and investigates with his eyes on the Śāstras, is called [a person performing] sacrifice through knowledge. 

[0;33;40m6.7
I shall teach you concisely about sacrifice through meditation. Listen to me. Meditation was taught by Hari in the past as of five kinds. [Meditation on] the Sun, the Moon, Fire, Crystal and the subtle Łtattva$ as fifth. 

[0;33;40m6.8
First it is the Sun [that should be meditated upon], which is said to be Łprakṛti-tattva$. He should visualize the Moon in its centre: that Łtattva$ is said to be Łpuruṣa$. 

[0;33;40m6.9
In the centre of the Moon's disk, he should visualise a flame, a fire. That is said to be Łprabhu$-Łtattva$, the destroyer of [the circle of] birth and death. 

[0;33;40m6.10
In the centre of the ring of Fire, he should visualize a spottless crystal. That is said to be Łvidyā$-Łtattva$, the never-born, imperishable cause. 

[0;33;40m6.11
In the centre of the disk of Łvidyā$, he should visualize the highest Łtattva$, never-heard, unparalleled, undecaying and imperishable Śiva. The fifth Łtattva$ of the sacrifice through meditation has been taught in short. 

[0;33;40m6.12
Vigatarāga spoke: Teach me, what are the fruits of [reaching] each Łtattva$? Which worlds can be attained and how much time [can one spend there], O great ascetic? 

[0;33;40m6.13
Anarthayajña spoke: Through meditation on the first Łtattva$, Łprakṛti$, [one reaches] Brahmaloka. He will rejoice [there] happily like Śiva for millions of ae ons. 

[0;33;40m6.14
If one dies while meditating on the second Łtattva$, Łpuruṣa$, one will depart from this world and go to Viṣṇuloka, [and will dwell there] happily for billions of ae ons. 

[0;33;40m6.15
Should one die while meditating on the third, the Łprabhu-tattva$, one can live in Śivaloka continuously for a hundred billion ae ons. 

[0;33;40m6.16
If he visualizes the nectar of Łvidyā-tattva$, [i.e.] Sadāśiva, he can reach [His] diseaseless, imperishable world [and can live there] well beyond endless ae ons. 

[0;33;40m6.17
The fifth one, the subtle Łśiva-tattva$ dwells in the Self. There is no counting of time there and he will be rejoicing [there] together with Śiva. 

[0;33;40m6.18
[If] he practises the five meditations, there will be no rebirth and no more fetters of transmigration. O excellent Brahmin, [the Lord] should be seeked, a wishing tree of desires, [as] he burns away existence. Liberation comes within one single birth! People, why should you not strive [for it]! [It is known] as the destroyer of all impurity. [It's ascertainable] by direct perception. It is not inference. It is to be experienced by one's own Self. 




[--- The third Niyama-rule: Penance ---]

[0;33;40m6.19
The first type of penance is mental penance, the second is verbal penance, the third is the bodily one, the next one is the one which is [characterised by] both mental and verbal action. The fifth type of penance is a mixture of the bodily and the verbal ones. 

[0;33;40m6.20
Gentleness of the mind, calmness, self-control, observing silence, and the purification of one's state of mind: mental penance comprises these five. 

[0;33;40m6.21
Verbal penance is taught as speech that causes no anxiety, which is kind, true and useful, and it includes also the practice of recitation. 

[0;33;40m6.22
Bodily penance is taught as the following: honesty, harmlessness, chastity, the worship of gods, and purity as the fifth. 

[0;33;40m6.23
[Penance] which is a mixture of the mental [and the verbal] is taught by the great sages to be these five: he should speak [about things that are] agreeable, of a virtuous character, auspicious, salutary and useful. 

[0;33;40m6.24
[Penance] in which bodily [and verbal actions] mix is taught by the great-souled ones to be these five: the worship of the guest and the guru, benediction, greetings, and blessings. 

[0;33;40m6.25
[Being] a [so-called] frog-yogin in the winter, or one with the five fires in the summer, or one who has the clouds [i.e. the open sky] for shelter in the rainy season: these kinds of penance is called Łsādhana$. 

[0;33;40m6.26
Carving out his own flesh as a donation, or [offering his own] hand, feet and head, or drawing [his own] blood (Łpuṣpa$) as a donation: all these are Łsādhana$-penances, 

[0;33;40m6.27
[as also] the `painful penance' and the `extremely paniful one', [eating only] at night, the `hot and painful' and [the one in which only food obtained] without solicitation [can be eaten], the Łcāndrāyaṇa$ and Łparāka$ penances, the Łsāṃtapana$, etc. 

[0;33;40m6.28
He who performs with a well-disposed mind this penance that puts an end to the suffering caused by transmigration (Łsaṃsāra$), abandoning the trap of hope, with a spotless mind, giving up the lowest rewards [such as] wishing for heaven, being a king and having enjoyments for the senses, will have an ultimate (Łsarvāntika$) reward. In this home of eternal births and deaths, man can bring about an accomplishment that puts an end to them. 

Here ends the sixth chapter in the ŁVṛṣasārasaṃgraha$.





------ CHAPTER SEVEN ------




[--- The fourth Niyama-rule: Donation ---]

[0;33;40m7.1
In the past the wise declared that, again, there were five kinds of donation. Donation of food, clothes, gold, land and the fifth, donation of cows. 

[0;33;40m7.2
From food [comes] energy, memory, the vital breath, growth, body, happiness. From food arise grace and beauty, heroism, strength. 

[0;33;40m7.3
Living beings live on food. Food always satisfies. From food arise desire, rapture, pride and valour. 

[0;33;40m7.4
Food drives away hunger and thirst and disease instantly. From donations of food arise beauty, fame, and glory. 

[0;33;40m7.5
He who donates food donates life. He who donates life donates everything. Therefore nothing is equal to the donation of food, nothing was, nothing will be. 

[0;33;40m7.6
In the absence of [proper] clothes, a man will also lose his fortunes. A person without clothes may not be respected by his wife, son, friends, etc. 

[0;33;40m7.7
Be it a learned person from a good family or an intelligent and virtuous person, without clothes everybody is subdued and humiliated on every occasion 

[0;33;40m7.8
because a man without clothes receives contempt and disrespect. Even if he is a great soul, he will wish to avoid the court, women, and the assembly. 

[0;33;40m7.9
Therefore the wise praise donations of clothes. One should not give away old, torn or dirty clothes. 

[0;33;40m7.10
[Clothes] should be donated [only if they are] new, not worn, soft, delicate and beautiful, ornamented, and accompanied by willingness and devotion. 

[0;33;40m7.11
They say that the reward [of donation/generosity] is in every case dependent on the particular [donor's] willingness and character, the choice of place and time, and on the particular recipient and material. 

[0;33;40m7.12
The reward received will be similar to the clothes donated. By donating old clothes, one would receive old clothes [as a reward]. By donating beautiful clothes, one would receive beautiful clothes [as a reward]. 

[0;33;40m7.13
Should one bestow very beautiful clothes on a Brahmin at an auspicious time, respectfully, he [i.e. the donor] will receive unequalled attractiveness and a beautiful appearance. When he departs, he will be given hundreds of millions of items of nice clothes, no doubt about that. Therefore do donate clothes often. It is the way up to the other world. 

[0;33;40m7.14
O great Brahmin, now I shall teach you about the donation of gold in a concise manner. It is a pure, auspicious and meritorious [act] and it washes off all sins. 

[0;33;40m7.15
Should one hand over [to someone] a golden bracelet or ring, O Brahmin, he will be freed of all sins, just as the moon is freed from [the demon] Rāhu [after an eclipse]. 

[0;33;40m7.16
If a person donates gold to Brahmins or gods, O excellent Brahmin, even if it is only in a minute quantity, he will be freed of all sins. 

[0;33;40m7.17
[The amount can be just] one Łrakti$, a Łmāṣaka$, a Łkarṣa$, half a Łpala$ or a Łpala$: this is exactly how the increase in the [size of the corresponding] reward will be, in proportion to the properties [i.e. amount] of the donation. 

[0;33;40m7.18
The wise praise the donation of land as the basis of everything [else]. Food, clothes, gold etc., all these originate in the land. 

[0;33;40m7.19
O Brahmin, one can obtain all the rewards of donation by donating land. If there is anything that equals the donation of land, O Brahmin, you should definitely tell me. 

[0;33;40m7.20
[Humans] have the earth as their abode as soon as they get out of their mother's womb. Land is said to be common to all that are mobile and immobile. 

[0;33;40m7.21
Be it [only a land of] one forearm, two forearms, fifty or a hundred, a thousand, ten thousand, a hundred thousand, donation of land is held in great esteem. 

[0;33;40m7.22
Should he donate a piece of land of [only] one forearm to a Brahmin, he will enjoy a billion divine years in heaven. 

[0;33;40m7.23
Thus in case of [donating] many forearms [of land], the reward is said to be proportional to the properties [of the land]. O Brahmin, I have taught you about the rewards of donation that is made willingly. 

[0;33;40m7.24
[Paraśu]rāma, the son of Jamadagni, having donated land to the Brahmin [Kaśyapa], obtained eternal life in this very world, O excellent Brahmin. 

[0;33;40m7.25
[A cow] with golden horns, silver hooves, garment and bell, O Brahmin, when given to a Veda-knowing Brahmin, [produces] rewards that are said to be endless. 

[0;33;40m7.26
Always rejoicing in the practice of giving, dots, as far as one's capacities go, one should give food, clothes, gold and silver, water, cows, sesamum seeds, land, sandals, parasols, seats, jars, cups or anything else. Making the [deed of] giving willingly (Łśraddhādāna$) something done with an unconditioned affection (Łrāga$) and reverence (Łvadana$), one's mind [becomes] spotless. 

[0;33;40m7.27
Glory and fortune that makes us happy come about only by donations, and one can gain unequalled fame. Only from donations will reproach [exercised by] the enemy [turn into] pleasure and happiness. Vigour and unequalled graciousness come from donation. One can reach attractiveness thought donations. Endless enjoyments surely come only from donations, and heaven is [reached] also because of it. 

[0;33;40m7.28
The whole world of Śakra [i.e. Indra can be taken into one's possession] by donations only. Donations make people happy. Supreme ruler[s] enjoyed all the land in the world only because of donations. Skanda (Łcandrānana$) appears as handsome and fortunate, with a [good] family[? verify] only because of donations. One can reach happiness that lasts countless births only through donations, there is no doubt about that. 

Here ends the seventh chapter in the ŁVṛṣasārasaṃgraha$ called Praise of Donations.





------ CHAPTER EIGHT ------




[--- The fifth Niyama-rule: Study ---]

[0;33;40m8.1
Five kinds of study are to be pursued by those who wish to be happy in this life and in the other: [the study of the] Śaiva [teachings], [of] Sāṃkhya [philosophy], the Purāṇa[s], the Smārta [tradition] and the ŁBhāratasaṃhitā$ [i.e. the ŁMahābhārata$]. 

[0;33;40m8.2
He should reflect on the Śaiva truth in both Śaiva and Pāśupata [teachings]. In those teachings the whole essence of truth is taught extensively. 

[0;33;40m8.3
Those who reflect on the truth (Łtattva$) can grasp the truth of enumeration [of ontological principles/reality levels] (Łsaṃkhyātattva$) from Sāṃkhya [texts]. The great sages taught [those twenty-five] Łtattva$s [of Sāṃkhya] as being in groups of five. 

[0;33;40m8.4
In the Purāṇas it is the sheath[s]/layers of the world that are described extensively. One can definitely enter [the realm] of the lower [world, i.e. hell], the upper [world, i.e. heaven], and middle [world, i.e. the human world], and the horizontal [world, of animals, by studying the Purāṇas]. 

[0;33;40m8.5
The Smārta [tradition] deals with the conduct of the social classes (Łvarṇa$) and disciplines (Łāśrama$), and with the procedures of Dharma and lawsuits. Good conduct is to be gathered from it without hesitation, with certainty. 

[0;33;40m8.6
A man who studies the epics (Łitihāsa$) will become omniscient. [All his] doubts about religious duty (Łdharma$), finanicial gain (Łartha$), carnal desires (Łkāma$) and liberation (Łmokṣa$) will be eliminated. 




[--- The sixth Niyama-rule: Sexual restraint ---]

[0;33;40m8.7
Listen with great attention, O Brahmin, to the five [spheres of] sexual restraint. Women, forbidden ejaculation, and masturbation are mentioned [in this context, as well as] offence while sleeping, O Brahmin, and daydreaming, as the fifth. 

[0;33;40m8.8
A woman is not to be approached sexually in daytime and on the four days of the changes of the Moon (Łparvan$), even if she is one's lawful wife. One should not have sex with a woman who is taboo or with one of those who have lost their class (Łvarṇa$) or are [of a] superior [Łvarṇa$ than oneself]. 

[0;33;40m8.9
Intercourse with goats, sheep, cows, mares, buffalo-cows is called forbidden ejaculation, which is to be avoided at all cost. 

[0;33;40m8.10
Rubbing himself against something else than a female sexual organ or rubbing his anus, are called masturbation (Łsvayaṃmukti$), therefore these are to be avoided. 

[0;33;40m8.11
Offence while sleeping, O best of Brahmins, has always been [considered] undesirable by the learned. [If] one enjoys women while sleeping, his semen will issue. 

[0;33;40m8.12
Sleeping by day should always be avoided by those who are intent on Dharma. These women are called `the bolts [that block the gate to] the path to heaven.' 




[--- The seventh Niyama-rule: religious observances ---]

[0;33;40m8.13
[Hear about] the five religious observances [called] the cat, the heron, the dog, the cow, and the earth. He buries his own urine and fae ces in the ground, O truest Brahmin. He rejoices [seeing] the sun and the moon when performing the cat observance. 

[0;33;40m8.14
O great ascetic, one should suppress all his senses like a heron, and should cultivate the peace of the mind, focusing on achieving liberation. 

[0;33;40m8.15
[He does] not [bury] his urine and fae ces in the ground, and he barks constantly. Lord Śarva [i.e. Śiva] is satisfied when one practises the dog observance. 

[0;33;40m8.16
A person practising the Cow Observance should never hold back his urine and fae ces. This is a terrifying [observance] that gives satisfaction, [as] stated in the Purāṇas. 

[0;33;40m8.17
Splitting [the earth] with spades and laid out on hundreds of pointed wedges: Goddess Earth bears [this] patiently. This is exactly how one can practise the earth vow. 

[0;33;40m8.18
He who practises these five religious observances with his senses subdued will, without doubt, reach this superior world [i.e. heaven?]. 




[--- The eighth Niyama-rule: Eating restrictions ---]

[0;33;40m8.19
Eating leftovers, [not] eating in-between [breakfast and dinner], eating [only] at night, eating food obtained without solicitation, and fasting: listen, I shall teach you these five. 

[0;33;40m8.20
[He who eats] the leftovers belonging to all the gods, to guests, and to the ancestors, he who eats the leftovers (Łśeṣāśin$) of servants, sons and wives, is [called in general] the one who consumes the remains of food (Łvighasāśana$). 

[0;33;40m8.21
if he never eats between breakfast and dinner, he will be regarded as one who is always fasting. 

[0;33;40m8.22
One should eat neither in the daytime nor in the evening, and should eat [only] at midnight if he wishes to follow the practice of [eating only at] night (Łnaktadharma$). 

[0;33;40m8.23
He who consumes food only without initiating [the donation], without asking for it, and eats [only] that which has been given by others is called [one who eats] unsolicited [food]. 

[0;33;40m8.24
Chewable and unchewable food, food to be sipped or sucked or drunk, as the fifth [category]: if one does not long for and does not consume [any of the above], that is called fasting (Łupavāsa$). 




[--- The ninth Niyama-rule: Silence ---]

[0;33;40m8.25
One who is disciplined in religious observances should observe silence in [i.e. should avoid] with regards these five: deceitful speech, malignant speech, insult, abusive speech, and bragging. 

[0;33;40m8.26
Fictitious [speech], [speech about] unknown [things], [speech about things] outside the range of Dharma, meaningless and unfriendly speech: these are called deceitful speech. 

[0;33;40m8.27
One who does not rejoice in others' fortune or in others' power, one who would like to see something disadvantageous [for others] is called malignant. 

[0;33;40m8.28
`[May your] mother and father be dead! How could failure come [to you]? Enjoy the love of unclean women!' [These are] called insult. 

[0;33;40m8.29
`Won't you burst in your heart, stupid? [Why] don't you break your head?' [If one utters] these or similar [curses], he is said to be using verbal abuse. 

[0;33;40m8.30
Relating fancy stories about gambling, enjoyments, fights, drinking, and women are the five types of bragging. [Thus] have I taught [reasons for observing silence], O excellent Brahmin. 

[0;33;40m8.31
Those who long for eloquent speech should always observe silence. One should speak true words without insult and idle talk. 

[0;33;40m8.32
He who does not observe silence is defiled and is the black sheep of the family. For a number of rebirths, [his mouth] will stink and he will become mute. 

[0;33;40m8.33
Therefore the speech of a person who always observes silence firmly, with resolution, will be impossible to ignore and it will make everybody in the assembly rejoice. The fragrance of lotuses and [other kinds of] rich fragrances will blow from his mouth. Thousands of faultless Łśāstra$s will be declared in the words of this person. 




[--- The tenth Niyama-rule: Bathing ---]

[0;33;40m8.34
I shall teach you the five kinds of bathing as they really are: fire bath, water bath, Vedic bath, wind bath and divine bath. 

[0;33;40m8.35
Fire bath is [performed] with ashes. Its fruits are a hundred times bigger than [those of a] water [bath]. For [anything] purified with ashes is holy. Ashes destroy sin. 

[0;33;40m8.36
Therefore one should use ash for it purifies humans of their defilement. Ashes yield appeasement for everyone. Ash is the ultimate protector. 

[0;33;40m8.37
Drawing [the sectarian marks on their foreheads while reciting] the Tryāyuṣa [mantra], observing chastity, all the sages purified themselves with ashes. 

[0;33;40m8.38
The gods, afflicted by their fear of Vīrabhadra, were set free with the help of ashes. Seeing the glory of ashes, Brahmā consented [to the use of this otherwise impure substance]. 

[0;33;40m8.39
[Thus] the Pāśupata observance was created, which is above [the system of] the four Łāśrama$s. Therefore the Pāśupata [observance] is the best because it involves carrying ashes [on one's body]. 

[0;33;40m8.40
A water bath (Łvāruṇa$) is to be performed with water in different ways by [different] people: in the water of rivers, water tanks, streams and ponds. 

[0;33;40m8.41
The wise know the Vedic bath as [the one performed with the Vedic mantra beginning with] Łāpo hi ṣṭhā$, O excellent Brahmin. It is to be performed at the three junctures of the day [dawn, noon, and evening]. It is called the Vedic bath. 

[0;33;40m8.42
He should go where dust rises among the cows on the paths as they pass by, and he should sit down there. This is [also] called a bath, [namely the Łvāyavya$ or wind-bath]. 

[0;33;40m8.43
One should immerse one's own body in the water-showers of the rain. The first and foremost Lord (Łmaheśvara$) of the universe calls it the heavenly bath. 

[0;33;40m8.44
Thus have I taught you the section on the Niyama-rules in divisions of five [sub-categories to each] because you asked me to, to favour the whole world. These fifty Dharmic [teachings] wipe off all the defilement. There will not be rebirth [for one who follows these rules], not even in millions of ae ons. 

Here ends the eighth chapter in the ŁVṛṣasārasaṃgraha$ called the Praise of the Niyama-rules.





------ CHAPTER NINE ------




[--- The system of three qualities ---]

[0;33;40m9.1
The whole universe with its moving and unmoving elements is divided by the three subdivisions (Łguṇa$) of time. Therefore the whole world is bound by the fetters of three qualities (Łguṇa$). 

[0;33;40m9.2
Vigatarāga spoke: What does the term `the three times' mean for an embodied creature that is made up of three constituents (Łdhātuka$)? Teach me about this in a somewhat more extended manner, O great ascetic. 

[0;33;40m9.3
Anarthayajña spoke: The three times are the three qualities (Łguṇa$). They are [all-]pervading and are born from Prakṛti. They support each other, they follow each other. 

[0;33;40m9.4
Sattva, Rajas and Tamas; Rajas, Sattva and Tamas; Tamas, Sattva and Rajas; they are mutually each other's pairs. 

[0;33;40m9.5
Lord Viṣṇu is Sattvic. [Brahmā], the one who was born on a lotus, is Rājasa. Lord Īśa is Tāmasa, [both in his] complete (Łsakala$) [form] and [as] formless (Łvikala$) Īśvara. 

[0;33;40m9.6
Sattva is of the colour of jasmine and the moon. Rajas is of the colour of ruby. Tamas is of the colour of lamp-black and colliryum. [This is how the colours of the qualities] are taught by the wise. 

[0;33;40m9.7
Sattva is water, Rajas is charcoal, Tamas is filled with smoke. All living creature are being burnt away by [the fire] of these qualities (Łguṇa$). 

[0;33;40m9.8
Vigatarāga spoke: By what sort of nooses of the qualities (Łguṇa$) is [a person] bound? Teach me the signs connected to them one by one, O great ascetic. 

[0;33;40m9.9
Anarthayajña spoke: [Creatures] are bound in many ways and by many conditions by the fetters of the qualities (Łguṇa$). Those who are deluded do not know. The Śivayogins do know. 

[0;33;40m9.10
He who is always established in Sattva goes upwards. He who is covered with Rajas goes in the middle. Those lowest of men in the state of Tamas go downward. 

[0;33;40m9.11
These three kinds of [Łguṇa$s] are to be acknowledged even in heaven, O great ascetic, and among humans and also among animals. 

[0;33;40m9.12

[0;33;40m9.23
The ten lowest Tāmasa [beings also include]: cuckoos, owls, Kañjala-birds, doves, and the five[?], Śārika birds and sparrows. 

[0;33;40m9.24
Makara crocodiles, cow-killing alligators and bears are of Tamas-Sattva. Tortoises, porpoises, crocodiles of the Ganges and frogs are of Tamas-Rajas. Conch-shells, pearl-oysters, shells, and Kavayī fish are Tamas-Tāmasa. 

[0;33;40m9.25
Sandalwood, aloeswood, lotus, waved-leaf fig-tree, Ficus Glomerata, holy fig-tree, Banyan, Devadāru tree, Śamī tree, wood-apple tree: these ten are Tamas-Sattva. 

[0;33;40m9.26
The ten Tamas-Rajas [trees] are: Citron trees, bread-fruit trees, hog-plum trees, pomegranate trees, jujube trees, rattan trees, Neemb trees, Kadamba trees and ... 

[0;33;40m9.27
Trees, creepers, winding plants, cane, bamboo, grass, plants, seaweed, rocks, grains are the ten Tamas-Sattva ones. 

[0;33;40m9.28
Bees, butterflies etc., worms, insects, aquatic animals, lice, bugs, mosquitoes, creatures in fae ces are Tamas-Sattva ones. 

[0;33;40m9.29
[These ten words describe] people who are the best among the Sāttvika [type]: compassion, truthfulness, self-control, purity, knowledge, observing silence, penance, patience, integrity, lack of self-conceit. 

[0;33;40m9.30
[These ten words describe] the people who are the best among the Rājasa [type]: desire, thirst, pleasure, gambling, arrogance, fight, intoxication, delight, cruel, quarrelling. 

[0;33;40m9.31
[These words describe] people who are the best among the Tāmasa [type]: violence, envy, incompassionate, stupid, sleepy, lazy, cowardly, idle, anger, greedy, cheating. 

[0;33;40m9.32
The Sāttvika can be characterised as follows: light, joyful, bright, always eager for yoga meditation, wise, intelligent and dispassionate. 

[0;33;40m9.33
The Rājasa can be characterised as follows: childish, skilful, passionate, proud, arrogant, greedy, desirous, jealous, and chattering. 

[0;33;40m9.34
The Tāmasa can be characterised as follows: anxious, lazy, deluded, cruel, a thief, pitiless, angry, wicked and sleepy. 

[0;33;40m9.35
Vigatarāga spoke: By what signs can the food of each [category of] humans be characterised? Teach me with regards to the three qualities (Łguṇa$), O great ascetic. 

[0;33;40m9.36
Anarthayajña spoke: The Sāttvikas prefer food that yields [long] life, fame, happiness, joy, which increases strength and health, which is savoury and which tastes nice, and which is soft. 

[0;33;40m9.37
The best food for the Rājasas is rather warm, acidic, salty, hard, hot and pungent. It gives you pain, a burning sensation and indigestion. 

[0;33;40m9.38
Tāmasas prefer food that is prohibited, impure and foul-smelling, stinky and stale. It causes indigestion, is sapless and tasteless. 

[0;33;40m9.39
Vigatarāga spoke: How can one recognize [the state of getting] beyond the Łguṇa$s, which leads one to the other shore of [the ocean] of mundane existence? Tell me truly about the liberation of those who are bound by the noose of the Łguṇa$s. 

[0;33;40m9.40
Anarthayajña spoke: Well, he who looks at all living beings in the correct way, as his own Self, O Brahmin, is to be known as one beyond the qualities (Łguṇa$), as one who has departed to the other shore of [the ocean of] mundane existence. 

[0;33;40m9.41
He who is indifferent to envy and hate, treats happiness and sorrow as equal, treats praise and reproach as equal, is called `one who is beyond the qualities (Łguṇa$)'. 

[0;33;40m9.42
He who treats pleasant and unpleasant things, enemy and friend, respect and contempt equally, is called `one who is beyond the qualities (Łguṇa$)'. 

[0;33;40m9.43
O Brahmin, thus has the exposition of the essence of the qualities (Łguṇa$) been taught to you. Those who are connected with the qualities (Łguṇa$) are mundane (Łsaṃsārin$), those beyond the qualities (Łguṇa$) are on the supreme path. 

Here ends the ninth chapter in the ŁVṛṣasārasaṃgraha$ called the Particulars of the Three Guṇas.





------ CHAPTER SEVEN ------




[--- The description of the pilgrimage places in the body ---]

[0;33;40m10.1
Vigatarāga spoke: Which pilgrimage place (Łtīrtha$) do the wise consider the best of all? Tell me, O best of sages, if there is one in the world that fulfills [all] desires. 

[0;33;40m10.2
Anarthayajña spoke: This question is an extremely deep secret. [Now that you] ask [me], O excellent Brahmin, I shall teach you, out of fondness, an ancient legend that Nandi told me. 

[0;33;40m10.3
Nandikeśvara spoke: On the beautiful peak of Mount Kailāsa, which is frequented by Siddhas and celestial singers (Łcāraṇa$), Devī asked Śiva, who was sitting there in his manifest form (Łsākṣāt$). 

[0;33;40m10.4
Devī spoke: O Lord, Lord of the chiefs of the gods, O ruler of all beings and of the whole world, I would like to ask you about an eternal secret concerning Dharma, 

[0;33;40m10.5
about the transcendental and highly secret pilgrimage place at which one can be liberated from mundane existence (Łsaṃsāra$). O Maheśvara, teach me the truth for the benefit of mankind. 

[0;33;40m10.6
Maheśvara spoke: Who else could ask me that question except for you, O Sundarī? Listen, I shall expound that question which is difficult to grasp even for the gods. 

[0;33;40m10.7
If one gets to know Kurukṣetra, Prayāga, Vārāṇasī, Gaṅgā, Agni[tīrtha], Somatīrtha, Sūrya[tīrtha], Puṣkara, Mānasa, 

[0;33;40m10.8
Naimiṣa, Bindusaras, Setubandha, Suradraha, Ghaṇṭikeśvara, and Vāgīśa, one will certainly be able to destroy one's sins. 

[0;33;40m10.9
Umā spoke: I have been taught this previously, O Mahādeva. [Which is] the pilgrimage place that yields all kinds of enjoyment, O Suranāyaka? 

[0;33;40m10.10
[And] how is one liberated from mundane existence by merely knowing [the pilgrimage places], O Īśvara? Cut [this] great curiosity arising [in me] that causes doubt. 

[0;33;40m10.11
Rudra spoke: How could I not know [the difference between] that pilgrimage place that is easy to reach and that which is difficult to reach? It is easy to reach for those who serve their guru. One can abandon the one that is difficult to reach. 

[0;33;40m10.12
Łkuru$ [in Kurukṣetra] is to be known as the soul (Łpuruṣa$), Łkṣetra$ as the body. Kurukṣetra is in the body, and it yields the fruits of [visiting] all pilgrimage places. 

[0;33;40m10.13
[And there will be] the obtaining of the fruits of all sacrifices, the fruits of all [possible] donations, and all the fruits of all religious observances and penance observed. 

[0;33;40m10.14
This is how the fruits [are said to be also] in the case of those fifteen pilgrimage places [from Kurukṣetra to Vāgīśa]. [Kurukṣetra,] the great and faultless pilgrimage place is extremely auspicious and pleasant. 

[0;33;40m10.15
Devī spoke: I am extremely thrilled, O Tridaśeśvara. Hearing about that which is easy to obtain, easy to perform and is subtle, my contentment has left me [that is, I want to hear more]. 

[0;33;40m10.16
Teach me further about the remaining fourteen pleasant [pilgrimage places], Prayāga and the others, one by one, as they really are, O Sureśvara. 

[0;33;40m10.17
The Suṣumnā[-tube] is the Honourable Gaṅgā, Iḍā[-tube] is the river Yamunā. [At the confluence of] these rivers is [the pilgrimage place] called Prayāga. 

[0;33;40m10.18
The right nostril is [the river] Vāruṇī, the left nostril is known as [the river] Asi. Because [it is] at the confluence of Vāruṇā and Asi, [the city/internalised pilgrimage place there] is known as Vārāṇasī. 

[0;33;40m10.19
She is called the ethereal Gaṅgā, and the nectar of immortality issues from her day and night uninterruptedly. That's why [this internalised pilgrimage place] is called Gaṅgā. 

[0;33;40m10.20
Somatīrtha is the tube Iḍā. It is characterised by the ringing of small bells. Upon hearing that [ringing], all of one's sins will be destroyed. 

[0;33;40m10.21
Sūryatīrtha is the [tube] Suṣumnā, the one that emits a soundless thunder. One is liberated by merely hearing it, even if one has mountains of sin. 

[0;33;40m10.22
Agnitīrtha is the Arjuna tube. It is charming because of the hum of Veda recitation. Upon hearing this or that syllable, one will become immortal. 

[0;33;40m10.23
Puṣkara is a lotus with eight petals and a pericarp in the centre of the heart. One should visualize the Subtle One in its centre [and] it'll destroy birth and death. 

[0;33;40m10.24
That goose on a lotus in the middle of the Mānasa lake is playful, acting gracefully, rising far beyond the other shore. 

[0;33;40m10.25
Listen to Naimiṣa, O Deveśī. It yields assurance in a moment. One can observe the shadow of one's own and others' soul properly. 

[0;33;40m10.26
He will see [the soul's] length with his eyes shut as one finger-breath. When one has seen the proof thus, one is called the knower of Naimiṣa. 

[0;33;40m10.27
Listen O Sundarī, I shall teach you the pilgrimage place called Bindusaras. The heart is to be known to be located in the centre of the body. In the centre of the heart, there is a lotus. 

[0;33;40m10.28
There is a pericarp in the centre of the lotus, and the subtle sonic matter (Łbindu$) in the centre of the pericarp. In the centre of the subtle sonic matter (Łbindu$), there is the subtle sound (Łnāda$). How is that subtle sound (Łnāda$) divided? 

[0;33;40m10.29
The subtle sound (Łnāda$) departs divided by the sounds U and M. Realizing that [subtle sound], O Viśālākṣi, one can obtain immortality. 

[0;33;40m10.30
I shall teach you Setubandha, which sports a current whose water of subtle sound (Łnāda$) cleanses you of the dirt of your sins. [It is a river whose] banks are the tongue, the throat, and the chest, and its sandbanks are the group of vowels (Łsvara$). It is wavy because its whirlpools are the voiced consonants (Łghoṣa$). Voiceless consonants (Łaghoṣa$) are its crocodiles and fish, the ten verbal classes (Łgaṇa$) are its sea-monsters, Łvisarga$s are its terrifying alligators. It is in the deep-sounding Łanusvāra$ (Łsā-anusvāre$). Go to Setubandha, have a taste of the pleasure of intoxication. 

[0;33;40m10.31
O Moon-faced goddess, listen to [the description of Suradraha], the way to the cessation of all sorrow, in the centre of the seven islands. It is frequented by Īśāna, a spotless lake in the heart full of the cool water of sound (Łnāda$). There is a lotus arising there whose petals are Prakṛti and whose filaments are split between Śaktis, praised as the five gross elements (Łvyoman$). It is to be honoured if one wishes to obtain the path to the supreme abode. 

[0;33;40m10.32
The tubes join[?]. The nectar of immortality (Łamṛta$) has descended by the Saviour Ghaṇṭikā. Those whose inner selves have become Sthāṇu [i.e. Śiva] are continuously delighted in Him, as he is embraced by the lotus in their hearts. [He is the one] whom Īśa's devotees can behold, who drives off the impurity of the Kali age, who is all-pervading (Łvyāpin$) and non-manifest (Łniṣprapañca$), the lord of gods, Ghaṇṭikeśa of undying existence. The ae rial Łbindu$ is a non-mundane (Łabhava$) pilgrimage place. 

[0;33;40m10.33
The banks [of Vāgīśvaratīrtha] are the gems of Mīmāṃsā, its sandbanks the [Vedic] Łkramapada$s, its water the meaning of the Śaiva manuals. Its flock of fish is the Pañcarātra [tradition], its winding path is the Śruti [tradition], its rapid waves the Smārta [tradition]. It is beautiful with its whirlpools of yoga. Its currents are the Upaniṣads. The foam made by its whirlpools is the ŁMahābhārata$. This river, whose form is the fifty voids (Łvyoman$), is the abode of the elixir. [This is the description of] the pilgrimage place Vāgīśvara. 

[0;33;40m10.34
One will know all the Vedas by knowing Him who puts an end to the suffering of transmigration, to birth, disease, separation, suffering, death, the floods of unbearable pain, to dwelling in the womb, to extremely insufferable sensations, and to places of suffering that are difficult to escape from. Such a person will, without doubt, reach Śiva's world that is difficult to enter even for the gods. 

Here ends the tenth chapter in the ŁVṛṣasārasaṃgraha$ called the Description of the bodily pilgrimage places.





------ CHAPTER ELEVEN ------




[--- The regulations on the Dharma of the four āśramas ---]

[0;33;40m11.1
The Goddess spoke: O Paraśreṣṭha, O Surottama! Is there another [form of] sacrifice that is for all (Łsarvayajña$), which is free of pain, is easy, and which does not require an abundance of materials, O Īśvara? 

[0;33;40m11.2
For the benefit of mankind, teach me, O Suraśreṣṭha, how one obtains the fruits of [this] universal sacrifice, [a sacrifice] praised even by the gods. 

[0;33;40m11.3
Maheśvara spoke: I cannot see anything comparable to your compassion towards living beings, O Bhāminī. What else could I teach [you] with respect to which [your] compassion is not evident? 

[0;33;40m11.4
I heard [the following] previously from Sadāśiva's mouth, O Varasundarī. Listen, O Goddess, I shall teach you the ultimate essence of Dharma. 




[--- The householder(?) ---]

[0;33;40m11.5
Sacrifice which [is performed] without materials satisfies all desires. It is undecaying and imperishable, and it removes all sins. 

[0;33;40m11.6
Material things (Łartha$) present many kinds of obstacle and [their acquisition causes] great fatigue, similarly to Indra's murder of the Brahmin [Viśvarūpa], which yielded results [i.e. sins] that were distributed [among trees, lands etc.]. 

[0;33;40m11.7
Material sacrifice can be purified with the five purifications, O Varānanā. When it is purified, the fruits are also pure. If it is not purified, there is no fruit. 

[0;33;40m11.8
The Goddess spoke: I am not sure about the five purifications, O Sura-śreṣṭha. Please teach [them to] me one by one, I want to hear [them] as [they] really [are]. 

[0;33;40m11.9
Rudra spoke: First [there is] the purification of the mind, then [comes] the purification of the substances. The third is the purification of mantras, then the purification of the ritual. The fifth is the purification of Sattva. The purification of the sacrifice is [thus] fivefold. 

[0;33;40m11.10
The purification of the mind is [achived] by mentally creating what is not against [the rules]. The purification of the substances is [achieved] by [using] substances that were not obtained by unlawful means. 

[0;33;40m11.11
Purification of the mantras is [achived] by properly applying (Łyuktatayā$) vowels to consonants. Purification of the ritual is [achived] by not altering the proper sequence [of the elements of ritual]. The purification of Sattva is [achived] by the non-prevalence of Rajas and Tamas. 

[0;33;40m11.12
When he has purified the ritual (Łvidhi$) thus and performs the sacrifice, he will obtain the fruits of the sacrifice, and will not undergo births and deaths [any more]. 

[0;33;40m11.13
But he who performs sacrifice without materials, O Varasundarī, will not [only] obtain its fruits, [but] of all sacrifices, without exception. 

[0;33;40m11.14
The sacrificial ground is [the internal] Kurukṣetra, he has made his abode in the house of Truth (Łsattva$). The great altar is the withdrawal of the senses (Łpratyāhāra$). The seat made of Łkuśa$ grass is constraint (Łsaṃyama$). 

[0;33;40m11.15
Vedic injunction (Łvidhi$) is the enumeration of Niyama-rules. [For the Vedic ritual fire it is now] the fire of meditation (Łdhyāna$) [that] is lighted. which is flaring up by the fuel of the firewood of yoga and is abounding in the smoke of penance. 

[0;33;40m11.16
The placing down of the chalice is knowledge of Śiva. [The oblation of] boiled rice is [now the process of] be[com]ing Śiva. The continuous oblation of clarified butter (Łājyāhuti$) is poured with the ritual ladle (Łsruva$) of the uvula (Łlambaka$). 

[0;33;40m11.17
Transforming concentration into an Adhvaryu [priest, the phases of] breath control will be the [other Vedic] priests[, the Hotṛ, the Brahman, and the Udgātṛ]. Samādhi which involves reflection (Łtarka$) and which is extensive is the [Vedic ritual of] burning the oblation (Łvayas-tāpana$?). 

[0;33;40m11.18
The sacrificial post is made up of the knowledge about the Brahman. The tying of the sacrificial animal is [the mental state called] Manonmanas. [The householder's] wife is Faith, O Viśālākṣī. [His] ritual intention (Łsaṃkalpa$) is [reaching] the eternal abode. 

[0;33;40m11.19
Rice oblation is the consumption of the nectar of immortality that arises from the victory over the five senses. The great [Vedic] mantra is [now] Brahmā's sound. Expiation is victory over the breath. 

[0;33;40m11.20
The consumption of Soma is [substituted now with] complete knowledge. The commencement [of the Vedic ritual] is the four Yama-rules. The ritual water-bath is [the study of] the epics. His garment is made of [his study of] the Purāṇas. 

[0;33;40m11.21
Ritual bathing and sipping water once are [to be performed] at the confluence of the Iḍā and the Suṣumnā. Having honoured Contentment as a guest, he salutes the Brahmin that is [now] Compassion. 

[0;33;40m11.22
The Brahmakūrca [observance] is the [state of mind called] `beyond the Qualities' (Łguṇātīta$), the scent of the sacrifice is the `spotless' (Łnirañjana$) [state of mind]. [His] sacred thread is the three truths (Łtattva$). The shaven head [of the Łsnātaka$] is [now] enlightenment. 

[0;33;40m11.23
The four Vedas are [now] Łnivṛtti$ etc. His seat is the four Łprakaraṇa$s. He should always perform a[n internalised] sacrifice after donating the priestly fee of providing being[s] with freedom from danger. 

[0;33;40m11.24
The attainment of sacrifice without materials has been taught to you, O Varānanā. [The sacrificer] will in any case obtain the fruits of up to a thousand [ordinary Vedic] sacrifices. 

[0;33;40m11.25
The first life-stage [life option] has been taught to you, O Varānanā, through Sadāśiva; [this is] the true Dharma, revered also by the gods. 




[--- The chaste one ---]

[0;33;40m11.26
[Now] learn about this, about the practice of chastity (Łbrahmacarya$). Listen with attentively, O Śubhā. [It is] the second life-stage (Łāśrama$), O Devī, the destroyer of all sins. 

[0;33;40m11.27
Religious observances are [now] meditation focussed on the Brahman. The Sāvitrī [hymn] is absorption in Prakṛti. The Brahmanical cord (Łbrahmasūtra$) is the subtle syllable. His girdle is now the abode of the three Qualities (Łguṇa$). 

[0;33;40m11.28
His staff is self-restraint, his bowl compassion. Alms are liberation from transmigration (Łsaṃsāra$). The Tryāyuṣa is the one beyond the two syllables. [The three lines are] prepared with the ashes of knowledge. 

[0;33;40m11.29
The bath-vow is life-long truthfulness, accompanied by the purity of moral conduct. The Agnihotra sacrifice is the three Łtattva$s. Recitation is the sound at the aperture of Brahmā. 

[0;33;40m11.30
The second life-stage has [now] been taught also to you as Lord Śiva taught it, O Devī, to me. It is the destruction of birth and death. 




[--- The forest-dweller ---]

[0;33;40m11.31
Listen, O Long-eyed goddess, I shall teach you the forest-dweller's way of life, which is revered by the sages and the gods, as I heard it, as it [really] is. 

[0;33;40m11.32
Having taken to the forest of indifference, he should take residence in the ashram of Niyama-rules, within walls that have the stone-strong gate of moral conduct, with his sense faculties conquered. 

[0;33;40m11.33
One's mother is the material realm, one's father the Self, one's guru the divine. Resolutions are one's brothers. 

[0;33;40m11.34
Śruti and Smṛti are his wives, Wisdom his son, Patience his little brother. Benevolence is his kinsman, his twisted hair [and] his bow. Compassion his sacred thread. Sympathy is the four ways of observing silence. All his religious duties are equanimity. 

[0;33;40m11.35
He is clothed in the Yama-rules instead of a garment made of bark, and he wears penance instead of the skin of a black antelope. He is seated on the highest level of non-attachment, and a firm observance is his yoga-belt. 

[0;33;40m11.36
Fire sacrifice accompanied by the sound of murmuring the Vedas is breath-control accompanied by [its] hissing. The herd of deer [in the forest where the forest-dweller normally lives] is [now his] conquered breaths. [Now] sacrifice is resolution, ritual is mantra-recitation. 

[0;33;40m11.37
His treasures are in the Łśāstra$s, his companions are self-control, compassion, etc. He should perform sacrifice to Śiva [as] the worship of the eight [yogic] practices (Łsādhana$). 

[0;33;40m11.38
Purified by the water of the five Brahma[-mantras], bathing and sipping water in the auspicious (Łśiva$) lake at the pilgrimage place of truthfulness, he should honour the three junctures of the day. 

[0;33;40m11.39
The rosary is [now] the meaning of the Purāṇas. Recitation is [now his] peace of mind day and night. His jar of epics is filled with the water of knowledge. 

[0;33;40m11.40
The actions of the five [medical] procedures are yogic suicide. Recitation is the five kinds of pleasure. The ŁŚivasaṃkalpa$ [hymn] is [yogic] practice (Łsādhana$), which yields fruits of yoga accomplishments. 

[0;33;40m11.41
His food is the fruit of contentment. He conquers lust and anger. His practice is the victory over the trap of hope. He prefers the joy of yoga meditation. The forest-dweller should observe his vow by providing guests with fearlessness. 

[0;33;40m11.42
One should follow the Dharma of the forest-dweller, the supreme Dharma, which has been taught and which, if first understood, will deliver one from transmigration, will remove transient existence, uproot ignorance, increase wisdom, will be fruitful, will deliver one from the flood of affliction, will remove rebirth and disease, and will burn one's bad karma. 




[--- The wandering mendicant ---]

[0;33;40m11.43
Here follows the wandering religious mendicant's Dharma. Listen, I shall teach it to you. Making joy and pain equal, he gets rid of greed and folly. 

[0;33;40m11.44
He should avoid honey and meat, as well as others' wives. He should avoid staying [at one place] for long and also staying at others' places. 

[0;33;40m11.45
He should avoid food that has been thrown away and he should avoid getting alms [always] from the same household. He should always refrain from accumulating wealth and from self-conceit. 

[0;33;40m11.46
Meditating on the subtle one, he should cast his eyes on his feet [when begging]. He should not get angry when he does not receive anything, and when he does, he should not rejoice. 

[0;33;40m11.47
He should not be agitated with regards to thirst for material things, or to violent anger. He should take praise and reproach equal, as well as pleasant and unpleasant things. 

[0;33;40m11.48
His garment is the Niyama-rules, and he is girded by the girdle of constraint (Łsaṃyama$). He makes his mind supportless, his intellect spotless, 

[0;33;40m11.49
the ground his self, the sky the mind-nonmind [state of mind] (Łmanonmana$), the three staffs [of the Łparivrājaka$] the three qualities (Łguṇa$), the bowl the imperishable syllable. 

[0;33;40m11.50
He should throw away Dharma and Adharma, and should give up envy and hatred. He should be indifferent to opposites, always dwell in truthfulness, being unselfish, humble. 

[0;33;40m11.51
He should go on his alms round visiting seven houses at the eighth part of the day. He should not sit down, he should not stay, and he should not say `Give me!' 

[0;33;40m11.52
He should live on what is available, on eight bites a day. He should not stick to items of clothes, food, or a bed, for long. 

[0;33;40m11.53
He should nor rejoice in death, he should not rejoice in life. Having conquered his senses, and having killed his desire, firm in his observances, 

[0;33;40m11.54
the mendicant (Łbhikṣu$) should never think about the past or the future. The wandering mendicant should always avoid anger, self-conceit, intoxication, and pride. 

[0;33;40m11.55
Making indifference a bow which is strung with the strings of breath-control, he should kill the beast that is the mind and the sense-faculties, with the sharp-pointed arrow of concentration. 

[0;33;40m11.56
He should stab the enemy that is transmigration with the extremely sharp knife of friendliness. He should defeat the rutting elephant of anger with the whirling discus of compassion. His body is clad in the armour of sympathy, his quiver is full of equanimity. 

[0;33;40m11.57
He should constantly recall the unutterable syllable which is the supreme Brahman, O Brahmin. Brahmā's heart is Viṣṇu. Viṣṇu's heart is Śiva. Śiva's heart is the junctures of the day. Therefore he should worship the junctures. 

[0;33;40m11.58
[Śiva] is deliverance from the ocean of mundane existence, the path to happiness, the Brahman, the junctures, the [sacred] syllable. One should always, unweariedly, meditate on matchless Śiva, who is to be recognized as the manifest soul. He should take refuge in Hara, who is devoid of form, colour, qualities etc., who is the supreme aim which is difficult to discern, honouring the divine guru with effort, who removes all pain. 

Here ends the eleventh chapter in the ŁVṛṣasārasaṃgraha$ called the Regulations concerning the four life-stages.





------ CHAPTER TWELVE ------




[--- The rules of hospitality ---]

[0;33;40m12.1
The Goddess spoke: Non-violence is always praised as the highest Dharma. Also, teach me the ultimate Dharma of the hospitable ones. 

[0;33;40m12.2
Maheśvara spoke: Hear the ultimate Dharma of non-violence and that of hospitality. O beautiful-eyed goddess, [if] all the three worlds, full of wealth, 

[0;33;40m12.3
[were handed over as] a gift to [a Brahmin who] knows the four Vedas, [that gift] cannot be compared to somebody who avoids causing harm. Hear the Dharma of the hospitable ones. I shall teach it [to you], O beautiful one. 




[--- The Story of Vipula ---]

[0;33;40m12.4
This is an old story of what happened once in a city called Kusuma. There was a famous and wise man called Vipula, Kapila's son. 

[0;33;40m12.5
He always followed Dharma, he conquered anger, he spoke only the truth, and he conquered his senses. He was pious and grateful, and he was my determined devotee. 

[0;33;40m12.6
He was rich and he worshipped his guests. He was generous, restrained, and kind. His wealth always came through just means. He always stayed away from illegal transactions. 

[0;33;40m12.7
He had a pretty wife whose face was as beautiful as the disk of the moon. Her breasts were round and elevated, she was lovely, a source of all pleasures. She was faithful, devoted to her husband and his needs. 

[0;33;40m12.8
Now, once there was an eclipse of the sun. Three quarters [of the sun] were eclipsed, and it was in the dark half of the month of Mādhava [April-May]. 

[0;33;40m12.9
Eager to take a ritual bath, the king and all the citizens the went down [to the riverbank]. Then they worshipped the gods and the deceased ancestors according to the rules. 

[0;33;40m12.10
Some sacrificed in the fire, some fed the Brahmins, some were of service with donations, others praised the deity. 

[0;33;40m12.11
Some people practised yoga meditation, others were engrossed in five-fire penance. While the ritual waving of lamps etc. were being performed all around the place, 

[0;33;40m12.12
Vipula also, there at the confluence of the Gaṅgā and the Gaṇḍakī, attired in linen clothes, performing a bath, together with his wife, 

[0;33;40m12.13
was engrossed in satiating the deities, the gurus, the Brahmins and others. Then, jumping on the possibility, a Brahmin came up [to them] as a guest. 

[0;33;40m12.14
The wife got infatuated with that Brahmin's extreme beauty. The Brahmin [felt] the same. His beauty was unparalleled. 

[0;33;40m12.15
Their gaze got fixed on each other mutually. Vipula joined his hands [and said:] `O virtuous Brahmin, 

[0;33;40m12.16
I am at your service, be gracious to me now, O great Brahmin. [My] wife, servants, cattle, village and all kinds of jewels [are all at your service].' 

[0;33;40m12.17
Having been addressed and greeted thus, in a hospitable way, by Vipula, the Brahmin spoke: `If you really mean to give, your heart is very generous.' 

[0;33;40m12.18
Vipula spoke: `My heart is generous today, generosity is the fruit of austerity. Just command me quickly, O Brahmin. What is your desire? There is nothing that should not be donated to a Brahmin, including one's own head, O Brahmin.' 

[0;33;40m12.19
The Brahmin spoke: `If you talk like this, dear Sir, give me your beautiful wife. May there be happiness, may you be fortunate, and may you prosper eternally!' 

[0;33;40m12.20
Vipula spoke: `Accept my nice-buttocked, young and beautiful wife, who is blameless, large-eyed and whose face resembles the full-moon.' 

[0;33;40m12.21
The wife spoke: `How can you abandon me, my lord? How can you dismiss a woman who is sinless? How can you abandon a wife who is extremely kind and faultless? 

[0;33;40m12.22
A wife is a man's friend in this world and in the other world. [Even if] a man gives enormous donations or performs numerous sacrifices, 

[0;33;40m12.23
or performs hard penance, he cannot reach heaven without having a son. I have heard this as taught by my father and my uncles, and by Brahmins in my presence. 

[0;33;40m12.24
A sonless man cannot reach heaven. I have heard this so many times! Mandapāla, the great Brahmin, went to heaven as a reward of his austerities, 

[0;33;40m12.25
having made numerous donations, having performed various sacrifices, Vedic sacrifices and sacrifices of recitation, that great Brahmin. 

[0;33;40m12.26
But even he, even when he reached the gate [of heaven], was stopped by the celestial messengers [saying:] ``The sonless cannot enter heaven, not even by hundreds of sacrifices.'' 

[0;33;40m12.27
Mandapāla, the great sage, having been thus informed fell from heaven. The Brahmin begot four sons with a Śāraṅga-bird. 

[0;33;40m12.28
By the virtue of this, he reached heaven unobstructed. I am a wife (Łkalatra$) [because] I protect the family (Łkulatrāṇa$), and I am a wife to be supported (Łbhārya$) because I bear [sons] (Łbharaṇa$). 

[0;33;40m12.29
Taking a wife is for the sake of having sons according to the Śāstras. Please give that Brahmin all the wealth at home, the village, the stations of herdsmen, and the houses, 

[0;33;40m12.30
but please don't give me away this time!' Having heard his wife's speech, Vipula spoke again. 

[0;33;40m12.31
`Alright, my beautiful wife, I know! Good, good, my faithful wife! I am beaten by this speach and I am satisfied with it. 

[0;33;40m12.32
Today the Brahmin came up to me at the time of eclipse, and he asked me. I promised him that I would give [you away]. If I didn't give [you to him], I would go to hell. 

[0;33;40m12.33
If I go to hell along with my family, I will be in hell, O brilliant woman, for millions of ae ons, and will not see release for millions of births. 

[0;33;40m12.34
I can see something bad, my Princess, from not giving, O woman with a nice compexion, but from giving I can see something good in heaven that is eternal. 

[0;33;40m12.35
I have never ever lied, I always observe the vow of truthfulness. If I transgressed the Dharma of truthfullness, [by this] I would stop following all other Dharmas [too]. 

[0;33;40m12.36
You mentioned earlier that the wife is one's Dharmic friend. If you are indeed Dharma's friend, it was actually the perfect time for him to come up to us today. 

[0;33;40m12.37
[For] Dharma himself visited us, disguised as a Brahmin. I am being tested. My dear, please don't cause me trouble. 

[0;33;40m12.38
The Unmanifest (Łavyakta$) is my mother, Brahmā is my father, intelligence is my wife, self-control is my friend. Dharma is my son, ritual is my teacher. These are my relatives. 

[0;33;40m12.39
The best time is the time of the eclipse of the Sun. The best one among the rivers is the Gaṅgā. The best day is at new moon, the best man is the Brahmin. 

[0;33;40m12.40
I have given you to the Brahmin to serve him, O beautiful woman. After I have given all my riches to the Brahmin, I shall resort to the forest.' 

[0;33;40m12.41
Śaṅkara spoke: The wife remained silent, her bewildered eyes filled with tears. [Vipula] took her by the hand and the long-eyed woman was presented to the Brahmin. 

[0;33;40m12.42
`I am ready to give you all the wealth I have at home, all the gold and the cattle, O great Brahmin, the village, the stations of herdsmen, and the houses, and everything else, 

[0;33;40m12.43
pearls, gems, clothes, and exquisite ornaments. Accept all these, O best of Brahmins. It's given in good faith and with respect. 

[0;33;40m12.44
May Lord Dharma be pleased and may Maheśvara be pleased. May all the ancestors rejoice if there is reward for meritorious acts.' 

[0;33;40m12.45
Rudra spoke: Having heard Vipula's speech, the ascetic Brahmin blessed the good-souled Vipula a good number of times, 

[0;33;40m12.46
and then went off to live in a nice house, taking Vipula's wife with him. As for Vipula, he said good-bye and circulambulated him. 

[0;33;40m12.47
Thus saluting the Brahmin, he departed quickly into the forest. In the forest, he lived off roots and fruits, and roamed the world. 

[0;33;40m12.48
But being alone in an abandoned and deserted place, he got overwhelmed with worry. `Where should I go? Where could I find food? From whom? What shall I do? 

[0;33;40m12.49
I don't know these roads, this country, these villages and these cities, towns, mountain settlements. I don't know anybody here. 

[0;33;40m12.50
I can see a nice mountain yonder with large cavities and caves. I'll climb it and try to figure out if there is a village, town or city [nearby].' 

[0;33;40m12.51
Having said this, Vipula climbed the mountain slowly. He caught sight of the shades of a tree, and, being exhausted, sat down [there]. 

[0;33;40m12.52
In the same moment, descending from among the branches of the tree, [a monkey appeared and] carrying an extraordinary, beautiful, fragrant, exquisite, 

[0;33;40m12.53
lovely, delightful and pleasant-looking fruit, it put it in front of Vipula, and then climbed back onto the tree. 

[0;33;40m12.54
Vipula, looking [at it] as if seeing a miracle, was perplexed. Wow, am I sleeping? Or is this the fruit of my penance? 

[0;33;40m12.55
I have never seen, smelt, tasted anything like this. I have not even heard of anything like this. I shall let somebody know about it. 

[0;33;40m12.56
Having repeated this several times, taking that nice fruit, he kept observing it smelling it again and again. 

[0;33;40m12.57
`While gazing at this fruit, and observing the countryside, I have run out of provisions. This fruit is godsent. 

[0;33;40m12.58
Therefore I shall take this fruit and enter that city, and I shall go and seek something to live on.' 

[0;33;40m12.59
Then crossing that mountain, he entered the city. He asked a man on the road: `What is the name of this city?' 

[0;33;40m12.60
The traveller replied: `Have you never been here before? This is the Deccan region, and this is the city of Naravīra. 

[0;33;40m12.61
The king is called Siṃhajaṭa, his queen is Kekayī. The king is very old, afflicted by old age, the queen likewise. 

[0;33;40m12.62
He is generous, an expert in all the arts, and he possesses the virtue of heroism in battle. He is pious and devoted to his subjects, and he is well-versed in the Śāstras.' 

[0;33;40m12.63
Vipula spoke: `As a matter of fact, I am seeking audience with the foreman of the guild (Łśreṣṭhi$). What is his name? Tell me. In which district is his dwelling? Tell me without any hesitation.' 

[0;33;40m12.64
Having been addressed by Vipula thus, the traveller replied: `My name is Bhīmabala and I have come to visit the house of the foreman of the guild. 

[0;33;40m12.65
The foreman of the guild is called Puṇḍaka and he is said to be a famous foreman. If you are eager [to see him], come with me.' 

[0;33;40m12.66
`Alright, let it be,' replied to him great-souled Vipula, and they set off to visit the foreman's house together. 

[0;33;40m12.67
When Vipula saw the foreman sitting in his house, he went up to him and offered him that fruit. 

[0;33;40m12.68
`Wow, what an excellent fruit! Hey, what a fruit we have here! Wow, what a form, what a smell, wow what a splendid fruit! 

[0;33;40m12.69
This fruit did not grow on earth, not even on Mount Meru or Mount Mandara. It is clearly from the world of gods, it does not grow in the world of humans. 

[0;33;40m12.70
Alas! Is it me who will enjoy this fruit? No doubt, [only] a king is worthy of it. Offering this divine fruit to the king, I shall please him.' 

[0;33;40m12.71
Then grabbing that pleasant fruit, he left hastily [together with Bhīmabala]. He approached the king respectfully, and gave him the fruit. 

[0;33;40m12.72
And seeing the fruit, the king was highly amazed. `O foreman, from where have you brought this charming fruit previously? 

[0;33;40m12.73
I have never seen such a palatable root or fruit or bulb, one with such beauty, fragrance, and qualities, one that gladdens the heart. 

[0;33;40m12.74
I shall eat this fruit that you have given me instantly. What does it taste like? I want to know. Give it to me quickly.' 

[0;33;40m12.75
Then he ate the fruit that looked like the ambrosia. The king devoured all of it, and its taste was like that of nectar. 

[0;33;40m12.76
In an instant, he obtained the youthfulness of a sixteen-year-old boy. In a moment, there were no wrinkles or grey hair, no illness, no weakness. 

[0;33;40m12.77
His hair, teeth, and nails, all became smooth and shiny, his teeth and senses strong, he regained his vital powers, his vision, strength, and his life energies in a moment. 

[0;33;40m12.78
The minister, the domestic chaplain, the counsellor, all the servants, the townswomen, and all the children, and all the elderly people, everybody was amazed. 

[0;33;40m12.79
The sovereign, namely king Siṃhajaṭa, became extremely satisfied and very happy. 

[0;33;40m12.80
The king, who was selfish and cruel, spoke to that foreman of the guild: `Tell Bhīmabala to bring another fruit today. 

[0;33;40m12.81
I have regained my youthfulness by your kindness, O excellent man. Help Kekayī, who is weak and old, regain her youthfulness.' 

[0;33;40m12.82
This is how the king addressed the foreman. Bhīmabala replied to the king, joining his hands reverentially, and remaining standing with his head bowed down. 

[0;33;40m12.83
`Your majesty, one cannot obtain [such a fruit by wondering] from forest to forest. It cannot be obtained through merchants or by cultivating the land. Some noble man, seeking your audience, 

[0;33;40m12.84
gave it to me, and, O supreme king, I gave it to you, your majesty. Your majesty, I cannot tell you who this foreigner is.' 

[0;33;40m12.85
Having heard Bhīmabala's reply, [the king] said: `You are the son of a noble family of ministers. Repeat my words [to Vipula]: 

[0;33;40m12.86
If there are no more [fruits], why did you give me one? This is what I request from you, sir. Where there is one, there will be many, that is for sure. 

[0;33;40m12.87
[There is a] path by which it arrived. He [Vipula] should go [back] by the same route. By all means, that's the way to go. Track it down by that route. 

[0;33;40m12.88
If you are unable to provide another [fruit], I'll have your head cut off, you fool. [Vipula] will be slain by Caṇḍa and Vicaṇḍa. Beware, Bhīmabala, he is a vile person!' 

[0;33;40m12.89
Then Bhīmabala got angry and drew his sword that looked like the [crescent] moon. [He spoke to Vipula:] `Obeying the king's orders, O son of a noble family, go hastily! 

[0;33;40m12.90
O son of a noble family, don't take it as an offence, but I have a licence to kill you, unless you have more of this fruit. Give another one to the king before the end of the day! 

[0;33;40m12.91
Reveal to me quickly where you found that exquisite fruit. Without that fruit, my friend, your life is in danger.' 

[0;33;40m12.92
Vipula spoke: 'As a foreigner, when I reached your house, I also regained my hope of life. How could one who does his duty be slain? I would fetch [another fruit] right now, 

[0;33;40m12.93
but there is no other fruit. Nobody can provide any. Up on the rocky peak of Mount Sahya, I sat down, disheartened. 

[0;33;40m12.94
It was a monkey that took that fruit, gave it to me, and then disappeared. I gave it to you, you gave it to the king. 

[0;33;40m12.95
Hey, let's go to that place, O foreman, to see if the monkey is still there. When we get there together, we can ask the monkey king [for more fruit].' 

[0;33;40m12.96
The foreman said: `Alright, let us all go together to the place where you found that fruit. We shall be saved, no doubt.' 

[0;33;40m12.97
Rudra spoke: Climbing that mountain, Mount Sahya, searching the place all over, Vipula then caught glimpse of that monkey, the monkey king. 

[0;33;40m12.98
`It's that extraordinary monkey there lurking in the shade of that tree. This monkey has showed up today again merely by the force of my meritious acts. 

[0;33;40m12.99
Hey, monkey, do me a friendly favour or I will perish very quickly. Give me another one of that fruit that you gave me, O monkey, and keep me alive.' 

[0;33;40m12.100
The monkey spoke: `It was a Gandharva that had given me the fruit that I gave you. How could I give you another one? Go there [where Gandharvas live] if you wish. 

[0;33;40m12.101
Vipula spoke: `If you cannot give me another fruit, [my] staying alive is doubtful. Another alternative is that we go where Citraratha himself dwells.' 

[0;33;40m12.102
The monkey replied: `Let's do it.' Then, upon reaching Citraratha's dwelling place, and having gone up to him, he said this: 

[0;33;40m12.103
`O king of the Gandharvas, I have come back to you with a request. Give me another of that fruit that you gave me, if you can.' 

[0;33;40m12.104
The king of the Gandharvas spoke: `I went to the world of Sūrya, and it was him who gave me that extraordinary fruit. I gave that fruit to you [because] you are my very best friend. 

[0;33;40m12.105
Where could I find another fruit, I don't have any, O monkey. Let us go to the world of Sūrya, and ask the Sun there.' 

[0;33;40m12.106
Having been addressed thus by the Gandharva, the monkey consented. They reached the world of Sūrya all together, the Gandharva and the others. 

[0;33;40m12.107
The Gandharva spoke: `I have come back to you with a request, O Sky-goer lord. Give me another of that fruit you gave me, and spare a life.' 

[0;33;40m12.108
Sūrya spoke: `I went to Soma's world, and it was he who gave me the magical fruit. That is how you were given that fruit, by me, out of my friendship to you. 

[0;33;40m12.109
I cannot give you another one. Go now to Soma's city. Ask him, [the Moon], the son of Atri, the lord of planets, without hesitation. 

[0;33;40m12.110
Rudra spoke: Led by Sūrya, they went to the world of Soma. Sūrya spoke to Soma, hoping for action on the Moon's part. 

[0;33;40m12.111
Soma spoke: For what purpose have you returned? O Sun, there will be a solution for that. Except for giving another fruit, I shall do anything. 

[0;33;40m12.112
Sūrya spoke: `If you can, give me a fruit, I am not asking for anything else. If you do not give me another fruit, I'll kill you.' 

[0;33;40m12.113
Soma spoke: `I shall tell you the way by which it arrived. Listen carefully. It was Indra who gave me the fruit and I gave that fruit to you. 

[0;33;40m12.114
If we go to Indra's palace, we can ask for another one together. Let us do it!' he said and left for Indra's residence. 

[0;33;40m12.115
Soma said this to Indra: `We have come here seeking a fruit.' Give me now another of the fruit that you gave me before, O Śakra. 

[0;33;40m12.116
Indra spoke: `The reason for which you came here does not exist, O Night-maker!. I received only a single one of that nice fruit, out of Viṣṇu's hands. 

[0;33;40m12.117
Let us all go to Viṣṇu's world, O lord of the planets.' They all went to Madhusūdana for the fruit. 

[0;33;40m12.118
After he spoke thus, they all left, led by the king of the gods. They reached the world of Viṣṇu in a moment, O Yaśasvinī. 

[0;33;40m12.119
Indra then approached Janārdana, bowing down respectfully. `I have a request, O Yaśodhara, for something that troubles everybody [here]'. 

[0;33;40m12.120
Viṣṇu spoke: `You all have come here for the fruit that I donated previously. I cannot give you the fruit. Otherwise, what else can I do for you?' 

[0;33;40m12.121
Indra spoke: `You are even capable of splitting Brahmā's Egg, O you of the banner with Garuḍa on it. I know that there is nothing that you cannot do, O Puruṣottama.' 

[0;33;40m12.122
Having been addressed thus, Viṣṇu replied to Purandara [Indra]: `O Kauśika, I can do everything with the only exception of the fruit. 

[0;33;40m12.123
I shall tell you the means of obtaining it. Listen to where it came from, O Gopati. It was Brahmā who gave me that one single piece of fruit, O Purandara. 

[0;33;40m12.124
I have given you that single piece of fruit, why do you want me to give you another one? Let us now go to the highest creator Prajāpati [Brahmā], and ask him for one. 

[0;33;40m12.125
I shall ask Grandfather Brahmā, O king of the gods, to solve your problem.' After he said this, they all left together, led by Janārdana: 

[0;33;40m12.126
Indra, Sūrya, the Moon, the Gandharva, the monkey, Vipula, the foreman, and the two envoys of the king. 

[0;33;40m12.127
They reached Brahmā's world in a moment, O Surasundarī. Seeing Brahmā's beautiful palace filled with all desirable things, 

[0;33;40m12.128
the innumerable wonders and different kinds of gems, the beautiful coral-tree roofs, the floors inlaid with cat's-eye gems, 

[0;33;40m12.129
the coral-gem pillars, and the diamond and golden altar, the coral-gem and crystalline lattice-window[s] and sapphire window[s], 

[0;33;40m12.130
Vipula [also] saw [that there were] various beautiful trees there, with their tops bent down with [the burden of] the blossom and the fruits. 

[0;33;40m12.131
The trees and the water seemed to be made of all kinds of gems. The trees, bushes, creepers, winding plants, and bulbous roots, and fruits, 

[0;33;40m12.132
Vipula, with his eyes open wide, saw all these consisting of gems. [There was] a multi-storeyed palace decorated with garlands of pearls, 

[0;33;40m12.133
embellished with millions of groups of Apsarases wearing all kinds of ornaments, and millions and millions of floating ae rial vehicles, and possessing everything wished for. 

[0;33;40m12.134
The assembly hall in Brahmā's world was charming and it shone like millions of suns. Brahmā was sitting there comfortably, [on a throne] decorated with various jewels, 

[0;33;40m12.135
with his four embodiments, four heads, four arms, and four hands. The god who is the governor of the four social disciplines (Łāśrama$) was holding the four Vedas. 

[0;33;40m12.136
He was at the same time surronded by the four Vedas: they were worshipping Him in their embodied forms. Gāyatrī, the mother of the Vedas, and beautiful Sāvitrī, 

[0;33;40m12.137
as well as the Vyāhṛti[s] [Bhur, Bhuvaḥ, Svar], and Praṇava [Oṃ], were serving [him] in their embodied forms, as well as [the mantras] Vauṣaṭ, Vaṣaṭ and Namaḥ in their embodied forms, 

[0;33;40m12.138
and Śruti and Smṛti and Nīti and Dharmaśāstra in their embodied forms, as well as the Epics, the Purāṇas, and Pātañjala Sāṃkhyayoga, 

[0;33;40m12.139
Āyurveda, Dhanurveda, and Gāndharvaveda, Arthaveda, and other Vedas, in their embodied forms. 

[0;33;40m12.140
Then Brahmā rose and went up to Janārdana [Viṣṇu]. Gifting him a cow and guest-water, he said `Please take a seat. 

[0;33;40m12.141
The one of the banner with Garuḍa on it [should please sit] on [this] divine throne made of gems and jewels. The king of the gods [Indra], the Sun, the Moon, the Gandharva, the monkey king, 

[0;33;40m12.142
and Vipula the great man should sit on [these] gem-throne[s]. Well done, excellent Vipula! Congratulations for your enormous (Łvipula$) austerity! 

[0;33;40m12.143
Well done, you of enourmous wisdom (Łvipulaprajña$)! Well done, you of enormous fortune! We, Brahmā, Viṣṇu, and Maheśvara, are all pleased, 

[0;33;40m12.144
[as well as] the Ādityas, the Vasus, the Rudras, the Sādhyas, the Aśvins, and the Marut[s]. Dive into the enjoyments in my world as much as you want, as you please. 

[0;33;40m12.145
This one amongst the millions of ae rial vehices has been built for you. There are thousands and thousands of sexy Apsarases, 

[0;33;40m12.146
adorned with all kinds of ornaments, making advances to you. [This state of affairs will go on] for a thousand hundred quadrillion ae ons, O great ascetic. Where there is effort, there one can enjoy [the results].' 

[0;33;40m12.147
Maheśvara spoke: Listening to His speech, Vipula, with his eyes wild open, shaking, trembling with fear, his bewildered eyes filled with tears, 

[0;33;40m12.148
bowing down his head, prostrating himself on the ground again and again, delivered a sweet speech to [Brahmā,] the Grandfather of Brahmaloka: 

[0;33;40m12.149
Vipula spoke: `Venerable Sir, Lord of all the worlds, Grandfather of all people, I can see a dream-like wonder, O Lord of the thirty[-three] gods. My memory abandons me, my mind's intelligence is darkened. 

[0;33;40m12.150
You keep the three worlds under control. Be my refuge. Protect [me] from terrible transmigration. I am afraid of being in a womb, and of the terror of old age and death. Protect me from the fetter of illusions. Dwelling in illness is eternal. Protect me, whose body is not controlled, from the noose of time. Animals existence means eating each other for many hundreds of Łyuga$s. Protect [me] from the darkness of illusions.' 

[0;33;40m12.151
Hearing [this] Brahmā spoke to [Vipula] of huge intellect, honouring [him] duly. `You will live until the universal floods of destruction. You will not have any longing for being reborn any more. There will be no dwelling in a womb for you, no rebirth, no anguish full of weariness. Killing the enemy that is the darkness of illusions, you will reach the ultimate, the absorption into the Brahman.' 

[0;33;40m12.152
Maheśvara spoke: When [Vipula] was addressed thus by Brahmā, Lord Viṣṇu [said:] `Let it be like that, bless your soul, just as the Grandfather said.' 

[0;33;40m12.153
[Then] Indra, Ravi and Soma, the Sādhyas, the Ādityas, the Maruts, the Rudras, the Viśve[śas] and the Vasus [spoke:] 

[0;33;40m12.154
`Wow, what a divine reward for great-souled Vipula's penance! He has reached heaven in his own [mortal] body by virtue of his worshipping a guest in good faith.' 

[0;33;40m12.155
This and many other things are related in the Vipula section. Viṣṇu, the lord of the whole universe, turned back to Brahmā. 

Here ends the twelfth chapter in the ŁVṛṣasārasaṃgraha$ called The Story of Vipula.






[--- Why is the easy method not followed? ---]

[0;33;40m13.1
Devī spoke: I have heard the Dharma of non-violence and of guest-reception in detail. Why do people not follow the easy method that brings about great rewards? 

[0;33;40m13.2
I have heard about the worship that resides in one's own body, about the penance that resides in one's body, and about the pilgrimage places that reside in one's own body, in full detail. 

[0;33;40m13.3
Why does my Lord teach the easy method that brings about great rewards? And why are the sages, the gods, and the people indifferent? 

[0;33;40m13.4
Mahādeva spoke: Now, as I am asked to do so, I shall teach you the secret, O Sundarī, for the benefit of mankind and to favour you, O Varavarṇinī. 

[0;33;40m13.5
From this day on, O Deveśī, it will be open knowledge (Łkhyāti$) in the world. The fortunate ones will follow, the unfortunate ones will not delight in it. 

[0;33;40m13.6
Because of the threefold bondage, in which the nooses are tied firmly, those who are stuck in it remain deluded, even if they are knowledgable. 




[--- Threefold bondage ---]

[0;33;40m13.7
Devī spoke: But what is this threefold bondage? Teach me, O you who repel my doubts. Even now, I am still confused, O Deveśa, by the threefold bondage. 

[0;33;40m13.8
The Lord spoke: The social classes (Łvarṇa$) and the social order of disciplines (Łāśrama$) are bound forever by [1] natural (Łprākṛta$), and [2] modified (Łvaikṛta$) bondage, and [3] the bondage of ritual reward (Łdakṣiṇā-bandha$). 

[0;33;40m13.9
After they have reached that ultimate realm, being ignorant, [people] fall back for the sake of a desired woman, in order to have sons, servants, to accumulate money and grain. The bondage of minds that are caught by affection is called `natural' (Łprākṛta$). 

[0;33;40m13.10
If one obtains powers by controlling the mind with yoga, [but] gets attached to this [state], then [they call] it `modified' (Łvaikṛta$) bondage. 

[0;33;40m13.11
If one's mind is attached to [donating] gardens, parks, and wells, to the fruits of donations and rites, ... that is called the bondage of ritual reward (Łdakṣiṇā-bandha$). 

[0;33;40m13.12
Tied with this bondage, and not being able to get free, people just keep running to and fro like a monkey. 

[0;33;40m13.13
They will trasmigrate through [births among the] gods, demons, humans, animals, and in hells, as if on a wheel-machine, until they understand the truth. 

[0;33;40m13.14
The pain of being in the womb, birth and death again and again, and then one dies of old age with anxiety about illness, sadness, danger, and fatigue. 




[--- Formation of the embryo ---]

[0;33;40m13.15
Devī spoke: How is the embryo produced, O god? And what kind [of development of an embryo] will the yogin go through? What kind of a womb will he end up? Allow us to hear this. 

[0;33;40m13.16
Listen, O Devī, I shall teach you the formation of the embryo in due order, to put an end to your doubts, O Varānanā. 

[0;33;40m13.17
From the imperishable is born Brahmā. From Brahmā is born the ritual (Łkarman$). From ritual arises worship (Łyajña$). From sacrifice arises smoke. 

[0;33;40m13.18
From smoke are born the clouds. From the clouds come the rain-clouds. From the rain-clouds food arises. From food living beings arise. 

[0;33;40m13.19
From food arises flavour (Łrasa$). From flavour arises blood. From blood flesh arises. From flesh fat arises. 

[0;33;40m13.20
From fat bones arise. From the bones marrow arises. From marrow arises semen. And man is born from semen. 

[0;33;40m13.21
The formation of the embryo is known to come from the union of semen and blood. The body is made of Fire and Soma, O Devī, because of the two elements. 

[0;33;40m13.22
Semen is said to be of the Soma element, blood is said to be of the Fire element. The body is taught to be the seat of Fire and Soma, O Devī. 

[0;33;40m13.23
Each month women have their periods, no doubt about it. One should approach them at the time of their period, and not for pleasure, O Varānanā. 

[0;33;40m13.24
One should enjoy [a woman] if one wishes to have a son, and for the sake of religious duty (Łdharma$), O Yaśasvinī. The man should enjoy the women[, and produce offspring,] like two sticks [rubbed together produce] fire. 

[0;33;40m13.25
Males are to be known as having an excess of semen, while females have an excess of blood. When the semen and the blood are in equal quantitiy, a gender-neutral [child] will be born. 




[--- Pregnancy with twins and triplets ---]

[0;33;40m13.26
Devī spoke: How does a woman become pregnant with twins or triplets? How are twin girls or twin boys born? 

[0;33;40m13.27
The Lord spoke: When there is an excess of blood, a daughter is born, O Varavarṇinī. When it is split into two by Wind, it will be twin girls. 

[0;33;40m13.28
And when the male, which has an excess of semen, is split into two by Wind, they will be twin boys. When it is split into three, they will be triplets. 

[0;33;40m13.29
When a woman has bathed after her period, if ... from the womb, [if conceived] on the first, second, or third day, it will not live. 

[0;33;40m13.30
On even days, he will beget a son, on odd days, a daughter. On the sixth, eighth, tenth, and twelfth days: it will be a male. 

[0;33;40m13.31
On the fifth, seventh, ninth, and eleventh days: a female. When blood and semen are even, the man will be dark-coloured. 

[0;33;40m13.32
The blood will turn into a spot in one day. This spot will become a lump in five days. 

[0;33;40m13.33
The lump will become a piece of flesh by the end of the first week. By the end of the second week, the whole thing will be flesh and blood. 

[0;33;40m13.34
By the end of the third week, it will have a heart. Then all the limbs and the head are formed. 

[0;33;40m13.35
When the heart is developing, [the women will experience] fainting, exhaustion, and loss of apetite. She will experience nausea, vomiting and weakness. 

[0;33;40m13.36
If the woman's heart is longing for something, and she asks for any food, be it chewable, sippable, drinkable, or any kind of delicacy, 

[0;33;40m13.37
a bed, a seat, gifts, clothes, or jewellery, anything she desires, one should give that to her immediately. 

[0;33;40m13.38
One should not cause her trouble, and should not ignore her. Her face is pale and greasy, her breasts and armpits dark. 

[0;33;40m13.39
Her body is inhabited by beauty, her thighs, buttocks, and groin are round and fleshy. By these sings, one should know that there is a [new] life in the womb. 

[0;33;40m13.40
By the fourth week, the head develops. By the fifth week, the neck develops. 

[0;33;40m13.41
By the sixth week, the shoulders and the limbs form. By the seventh week, the backbone develops. 

[0;33;40m13.42
By the eighth week, the two hands form. By the ninth week, the ribs develop. 

[0;33;40m13.43
By the tenth week, the two feet develop. By the eleventh week, the abdomen forms. 

[0;33;40m13.44
By the twelfth week, the flanks of the abdomen form. By the thirteenth week, its buttocks develop. 

[0;33;40m13.45
By the ninety-eighth night [i.e. by the fourteenth week], the ten fingers and ten toes develop. By the fifteenth week, all the fat is developed. 

[0;33;40m13.46
By the sixteenth week, all the bones are formed. By the seventeenth week, the sinews are fixed. 

[0;33;40m13.47
By the eighteenth week, the face develops. By the nineteenth week, the nasal canal is formed. 

[0;33;40m13.48
By the twentieth week, the veins of the eye develop. By the twenty-first week, the two ears form. 

[0;33;40m13.49
By the twenty-second week, the two eyebrows form. By the twenty-third week, the two cheeks develop. 

[0;33;40m13.50
By the twenty-fourth week, the two lips develop. By the twenty-fifth week, the tongue is born, O Sundarī. 

[0;33;40m13.51
By the twenty-sixth week, the gums develop. By the twenty-seventh week, the testicles form. 

[0;33;40m13.52
By the twenty-eighth week, the womb and the penis develop. By the twenty-ninth week, the skin forms. 

[0;33;40m13.53
By the thirtieth week, the navel develops. By the thirty-first week, all the cavities are formed. 

[0;33;40m13.54
By the thirty-second week, the twenty nails are formed. By the thirty-third week, hair on the body and on the head grow. 

[0;33;40m13.55
By the thirty-fourth week, all the joints are formed. By the thirty-fifth week, all the Łmarman$-joints are formed. 

[0;33;40m13.56
By the thirty-six week, consciousness arises. By the thirty-seventh week, envy and hatred arise. 

[0;33;40m13.57
By the thirty-eighth week, being composed of the five elements (Łpañcātmaka$), having all limbs and a full body, it is fully developed. 

[0;33;40m13.58
It is breathing and drinking from the mother, from a flow [of nutrients] through the umbilical cord. Humans nourish a child that has been born just as they do a baby in the womb. 

[0;33;40m13.59
Then consciousness enters the mind, as do sleeping and dreaming.[?or as sleep enters dreaming?] It cannot [be?] perceived because of its subtlety, like the fire [that resides inside] the sticks [that produce fire cannot be seen?]. 

[0;33;40m13.60
Wet with the amniotic fluid, he is surrounded by the fetal membranes. Being in there, the child, now being conscious, starts remembering [previous] births. 

[0;33;40m13.61
`I died and am now reborn. And I am dying again. I am reborn in thousands of different plants, 

[0;33;40m13.62
in thousands of animals, as ghosts in hells, as thousands of humans in the four main social classes (Łvarṇa$) and in mixed castes. 

[0;33;40m13.63
And now I am again an embryo, in unbearable anguish. Now I am a newborn baby, being purified by rituals (Łsaṃskāra$). 

[0;33;40m13.64
I will do nothing but practise yoga or the Sāṃkhya of twenty-five [Łtattva$s]. Where there is no birth and no aging, and where there is no death, 

[0;33;40m13.65
where the Brahman is the ultimate doctor, I shall go there, keeping my vows firmly.' It thinks about these and many similar things again and again. 

[0;33;40m13.66
While in the womb, it remembers its previous births. Then the human is born with great difficulty and great pain, 

[0;33;40m13.67
tormented by the mechanisms of the vagina, in incredible pain. As soon as it is born, it forgets its [previous] lives in this world, unconscious. 

[0;33;40m13.68
[The baby] is hit by the hard hammer of Māyā. How could it act in an auspicious way? This is how I have told you the formation of the embryo, O Varānanā, the first [stage] of the suffering in transmigration (Łsaṃsāra$). What else would you like to hear? 



------ CHAPTER FOURTEEN ------




[--- Differences in body-shapes and skin-colours ---]

[0;33;40m14.1
Devī spoke: How does a person become extremely tall or very short? Why does one person have an extremely fair complexion, and the other very dark, O Lord? 

[0;33;40m14.2
The Lord spoke: If a pregnant woman always stands upright, the son will have an expanded and symmetrical body, and will be extremely tall. 

[0;33;40m14.3
If a pregnant woman always lies down in a contracted posture, and indulges in pungent juices and food, the son will be short. 

[0;33;40m14.4
If a pregnant woman always drinks milk, eats Łvara$ and Łkodrava$ grains and rice, and barley-porrige, 

[0;33;40m14.5
wears white clothes and white garlands, she will give birth to [offspring] with extremely pale complexion. If a pregnant woman loves black-coloured grains, 

[0;33;40m14.6
black beans, black sesamum, black Mungo beans, and porridge made of black barley, [and wears] dark clothes and garlands, she will have a son with dark skin. 




[--- Birth defects ---]

[0;33;40m14.7
Devī spoke: Why is a person born blind, gender-neutral, timid, with ruined sense-faculties, hump-backed, dwarfish, a weakling, or with an enourmous head? 

[0;33;40m14.8
The Lord spoke: If a pregnant woman indulges in hot and pungent [food], in garlic and onion, the root of the wood-apple tree, 

[0;33;40m14.9
berries, ginger, mustard, and black pepper, alcohol, and other [types of] harmful[?], pungent and bitter [food], [i.e.] she who enjoys hot [food] will give birth to a blind child. 

[0;33;40m14.10
When the semen and blood of the man and the woman who have been mistreated[?] ... [vyāpanna?] and the woman's blood flows into the womb first, and then the semen at the time of the period???, then a gender-neutral child will be born..... 

[0;33;40m14.11
When a woman is afraid of men, is frightened or terrified, and offspring is born, then what is born from her womb will be a coward, a crybaby. 

[0;33;40m14.12
Should any obstacle arise for the semen at the moment of ejaculation, ...... then [the child] will be born without any sense faculties. 

[0;33;40m14.13
If a pregnant woman indulges in eating pulses, in pungent, astringent, and especially, bitter [food], 

[0;33;40m14.14
her Łvāta$ humour will be agitated, and she will stand in a bent posture. A hump-backed child will be born from that womb because of the compression of Łvāta$. 

[0;33;40m14.15
She who is always sitting or squatting will crush the embryo, which will by this be born a dwarf. 

[0;33;40m14.49
Devī spoke: Why does beard and baldness arise for men and not for women? 



------ CHAPTER FIFTEEN ------




[--- The description of the soul ---]

[0;33;40m15.1
The goddess spoke: A certain `soul being' was mentioned. What are [its] characteristics? I do not know about its location or form or colour, O Īśvara. 

[0;33;40m15.2
This is what I'm curious about. Drive my doubts away, Parameśvara. I cannot see anything else [as vitally important]. Teach me the details of the soul. 

[0;33;40m15.3
Īśvara spoke: O Goddess, who could be able to talk about the characteristics of the soul? There is no such thing as the form or colour of the soul or its location. 

[0;33;40m15.4
Its pervasive, omnipresent, subtle, it exists dwelling in everything. It is supportless, it is not contained in anything, it is unparalleled and spotless. 

[0;33;40m15.5
As fire [hidden] in fire-kindling sticks[?] is not perceivable in the wood, similarly the soul cannot be seen although it dwells in the body, O Sundarī. 

[0;33;40m15.6
Just as ghee can and cannot be seen in[?] curd[?], in the same way the soul in the body can and cannot be seen. 

[0;33;40m15.7
The goddess spoke: Is it without any direct proof? Is there no way to directly see any proof [of its existence]? How is it pervasive, O Mahādeva? How can it be omnipresent? 

[0;33;40m15.8
Maheśvara spoke: It is doubtlessly pervasive, omnipresent, it is Śiva. It can be perceived through its contact with the senses. [That is] the direct perception of the evidence of [the existence of] the soul. 

[0;33;40m15.9
As air in the sky is endowed with the qualities of sound and touch, similarly one can perceive the soul through the functioning of its qualities and in no other way. 

[0;33;40m15.10
The goddess spoke: The soul was mentioned earlier as being pervasive and also omnipresent. [I suppose] you said that [only] idly. In this case, why does [the soul] die? 

[0;33;40m15.11
Īśvara spoke: O Goddess, nobody's soul ever dies, O Surasundarī. As [in the case of] space inside a pot, and space outside it, 

[0;33;40m15.12
there is no perceivable difference when the pot is broken to pieces, O Viśālākṣī. [Similarly,] when the body perishes, O goddess, there is no perceivable destruction [of the soul]. 

[0;33;40m15.13
It is extremely subtle, omnipresent, pervasive, it is the supreme soul, it is imperishable. It is outside and inside the living beings. It is immovable and moving. 

[0;33;40m15.14
It is immeasurable, imperishable, unmanifest and manifest. It appears as having the qualities of all the senses but is devoid of senses. 

[0;33;40m15.15
Thus have I briefly described to you, O Mahādevī, the soul. O Varavarṇinī, what else would you like to hear? 




[--- The best ---]

[0;33;40m15.16
The goddess spoke: O Mahādeva, O Īśāna, Īśvara! Tell me what is the best in essence. I would like to hear it, O Deveśa. Tell me for the benefit of mankind. 

[0;33;40m15.17
Īśvara spoke: The best life-stage is that of the householder (Łgṛhin$). The best social classes are the twice-born ones. The best ritual is the Łaśvamedha$. The best recitation is the Łaghamarṣaṇa$. 

[0;33;40m15.18

[0;33;40m15.19
The best cloth is linen. The best ornament is fame. The best Śruti is the Mahābhārata. The best of vows is compassion. 

[0;33;40m15.20
The best donation is the freedom from danger. The best sense-faculty is the mind. The best way to accumulate wealth is accumulate knowledge. The best word is the truthful one. 

[0;33;40m15.21
The best weapon is the bow. The best relatives are the mothers. The best medicine is knowledge. The best doctor is Śiva's syllable. 

[0;33;40m15.22
The best letter is `a'. The best Dharma is non-violence. The best domestic animal is the cow. The best person is the king. 

[0;33;40m15.23
The best month is Mārgaśiras. The best of the four ae ons is the Kṛta. The best season is spring. The best path of the Sun is the northern one. 

[0;33;40m15.24
The best day is the day of the new-moon. The best planet is the Sun. The best among women are Lakṣmī and Dhṛti [two of Dharma's thirteen wives]. The best Vasu is Agni. 

[0;33;40m15.25

[0;33;40m15.29
O goddess, having told you this summary of the essence of everything in an extracted form, O Varānanā, what shall I tell you further? 

Here ends the fifteenth chapter in the Vṛṣasārasaṃgraha called the Description of the Soul.





------ CHAPTER SIXTEEN ------




[--- The exposition of the essence of yoga ---]

[0;33;40m16.1
The goddess spoke: Now I would like to hear the exposition of the essence of yoga. Furthermore teach me about the Karaṇa [exercises, practice?], according to the rules, O Sureśvara. 

[0;33;40m16.2
Īśvara spoke: Listen, o Devī, I shall teach you the supreme essence of yoga, by knowing which people don't have to face the fetters of mundane existence. 

[0;33;40m16.3
[One can be] a Brahmin-slayer, a violator of his teacher's bed, a drunkard, a thief or can be born into a mixed caste: it [i.e. yoga] will eliminate all [of his sins]. 

[0;33;40m16.4
He who engages in Prāṇāyāma for [just] half a moment or for a moment, [and] focuses on the object to be visualized (dhyeya) will have those sins destroyed ... [kṣaṇāt? cf. parallel] 

[0;33;40m16.5
Mighty [balavat] Yama, the cruel Ender, frightening-looking death will not take possession of the brave yogin. 

[0;33;40m16.6
Just as the faults of all metals are burnt out by blowing [the fire that heats] them, in the same way sins are surely burnt away by the control of the breath. 

[0;33;40m16.7
There is nothing like a thousand Aśvamedha sacrifices, a hundred Rājasūya rituals or a hundred [rounds of] prāṇāyāma. 

[0;33;40m16.8
By sacrifice, one can reach the gods [Veda?]. The result of austerities is sovereignty [in yoga?]. By renunciation, one reaches Brahmā's place, and by indifference, Prakṛti's abode. 

[0;33;40m16.9
By knowledge, one attains kaivalya and the supreme and eternal Brahman [Sāṃkhya?]. These are taught to be the five paths according to the rules. 

[0;33;40m16.10
He will get beyond all sins and will attain immortality, if the knower of yoga practises yoga for half a moment or for a moment, 

[0;33;40m16.11
Even if he practises diligently, until he knows the Truth, he will surely abide in Brahmā's and Viṣṇu's homes, O Sundarī, 

[0;33;40m16.12
and when his merits are exhausted, he will be born in the world of mortals, in a noble family. He will experience thousands of karmas, while he has all possible desires. 

[0;33;40m16.13
He should practise only yoga, and he will be a man who remembers his own previous births. He should practise only yoga, and he will be a man who remembers his own previous births. Crossing the ocean of mundane existence, he will obtain Śivaness. 




[--- The technique of yoga ---]

[0;33;40m16.14
The goddess spoke: I wish to hear about the method of yoga. Teach me, O Puruṣottama, O Sureśvara, about meditation, concentration and the Powers. 

[0;33;40m16.15
Maheśvara spoke: Listen, I shall teach you the method of yoga, the destroyer of the noose of existence. [With his body] purified and his mind concentrated, the yogin should sit down assuming a sitting posture (āsana) in a place which is devoid of humans and noise, and he should think of the Supreme Soul. 

[0;33;40m16.16
[The āsanas are:] padmaka, svastika, niṣkala, añjali, ardhacandra, daṇḍa, paryaṅka, and bhadra. 

[0;33;40m16.17
He should practise yoga by assuming [any one of] these āsanas, holding his trunk, head and neck level, staying [in the position] without any movement. 

[0;33;40m16.18
Withdrawal of the senses (pratyāhāra), meditation (dhyāna), breat-controll (prāṇayāma), concentration (dhāraṇā), reflection (Łtarka$), and samādhi: these are called the six-limbed yoga/ yoga with six ancillaries. 

[0;33;40m16.19
That [method] which draws in the senses that are clinging on to the objects again and again [see DhP] with the help of the mind is called withdrawal of the senses. 

[0;33;40m16.20
O Devī, [the yogin] should concentrate on the [five] sense-objects beginning with sound after he has made them into a ball. His passions gone, dwelling in samādhi, he should join the object of meditation with the object[?]. 

[0;33;40m16.21
The Self is the meditator (dhyātṛ), the mind is meditation (dhyāna), the object of meditation (dhyeya) is Pure Supreme Śiva As regards supreme sovereignty, [that] is the only aim in it [i.e. in dhyāna]. 

[0;33;40m16.22
Inhalation, breath retention, then exhalation, and the tranquillized one: prāṇāyāma is fourfold. 

[0;33;40m16.23
During inhalation, the wise one should establish the fire through his great-toe. By breath retention he should stop it [i.e. the fire] and visualize it [i.e. himself] as being burnt. 

[0;33;40m16.24
Then, while exhaling, he should imagine himself as reduced to ashes. Now his Self has a purified body, one which is as spotless as a clear crystal. 

[0;33;40m16.25
[When this is maintained for] twelve measures of time, that is called nirvāṇa/exhalation? Concentration (dhāraṇā) is twice as long as breath-control (prāṇāyāma), there is no doubt about it. 

[0;33;40m16.26
As regards yoga, it (dhāraṇā?) is said to be three times as long, in saṃkrama it is four times longer. In case of ritual suicide (utkrānti) is concerned, it is five times longer. [To reach] yogic Powers (yogasiddhi) [it takes] six times longer. 

[0;33;40m16.27
[The yogin should] always be practising yoga with the six ancillaries. Yoga is taught as having two forms: mental (mānasa) and simultaneous?? (yaugapadya). 

[0;33;40m16.28
[The yogin] can meditate on the supreme subtle one only mentally, without performing breath-control: that type of yoga is called mental [yoga] (mānasa). 

[0;33;40m16.29
[If the yogin] controls his breath with his mind, and his mind with breath-control, and thus meditates on the supreme subtle one, that is called simultaneous [yoga] (yaugapadya). 

[0;33;40m16.30
I shall teach you the signs of success in yoga, listen, O Sundarī. When a conch-shell, kettle-drum, mṛdaṅga-drum, flute or dundubhi-drum is beaten, he will not perceive [the sound] when he has reached such-ness [i.e. Śivaness]. 

[0;33;40m16.31
Similarly, he will not be able to tell cold from heat, joy from sadness, he will not experience thirst or hunger or pain, when he attains success in yoga, O Sundarī. 

[0;33;40m16.32
This is how I taught the technique of yoga in a nutshell, O Devī, as a reply to your question, O Sundarī. What else shall I teach you? 

[0;33;40m16.33
The goddess spoke: Tell me about the liberation from mundane existence without yoga, O Deveśa! O Mahādeva, [that could] free [one's] mind of doubts/hesitation. 

[0;33;40m16.34
Maheśvara spoke: Sighing is Sadāśiva, a deep breath is supreme Śiva. In between the two, there is Śiva the supreme and imperishable Self. 

[0;33;40m16.35
For one [who knows this], there is neither yoga meditation and nor karaṇa. He is liberated by merely knowing [this]. What else would you like to ask? 




[--- The five Śāstras ---]

[0;33;40m16.36
I shall teach you another kind of knowledge. Listen, O Devī, listen to me. Listen in short to the [its] exposition as constructed in the five śāstras, in Sāṃkhya, in yoga, in the Pañcarātra, in Śaivism and in the Vedas. 

[0;33;40m16.37
The quintessential yoga which is established in Sāṃkhya, and which is for [liberation from] the terrible ocean of mundane existence, and which I am teaching you now, is there for you as a certainty in essential yoga [teachings], and in the Pañcarātra, in the Vedas, and in Śaivism. 

[0;33;40m16.38
If all of [his] senses beginning with smelling, and also his mind, are dissolved, so to say, and if he suppresses all sensations (bhāva) with his mind, he will attain his aim and will find refuge in Śiva. 

[0;33;40m16.39
[When there is] motionlessness of all senses beginning with hearing, and his attention (cittaṃ), controlled by his mind, becomes focused (ekāgra), his body will slowly disappear. This is called `success in union' by the experts. 

[0;33;40m16.40
First, he should slowly stop his mind [or subj. = manas?], subduing the sense[s] until it [the senses] dissolve[s] together with the mind [see above]. Thus [the yogin's] body is rendered unconscious/senseless. [The yogin] certainly attains this yoga in its entirety, namely meditation and samādhi. Why is it [if] somebody does not seek [this] essence extracted[? mathitam might be better] from ten thousand million books? 

[0;33;40m16.41
He has conquered his joy in his Self, [instead] he rejoices in samādhi and he has also taken refuge in indifference (vairāgya). When the end comes, his mind will remain [in] corporal form??? That is to be known as the highest path, Śiva's abode, which puts an end to mundane suffering. And this is taught as `completion' [niṣṭhā!] in the Vedānta (in the Upaniṣads?). Why should anyone resort to any other teaching? 

[0;33;40m16.42
On [upari, here with loc.] the pericarp of the heart-lotus, there is a sun, illuminating the intermediate space. There is a lamp lit by the shining of the most dense mass of rays of its light, which having pierced the mouth at the soft palate, goes upwards through the soft palate towards the top of the head. Those practising yoga leave for Śiva's supreme abode through the door on the top of their heads. 

[0;33;40m16.43
[Tentative:] Kṛṣṇa, the highest of the darkest ones, the extremely great one, who is essentially the splendour of light/who shines/is sharp, the one who has never been born, the supporter of the world and the non-world and of the earth, husband to Śrī, abiding in the breath, the imperishable creator, the imperishable cause,[?] he the [all-]pervading, the arranger/distributor?, ...? Viṣṇu, ..., the lord of the universe, the omniscient one. 

[0;33;40m16.45
is viewing the senses and the mind inside the body through the Buddhi which is transformed by meditation. That Puruṣa is located in the abode in the heart-lotus, he who gives us exhalation and inhalation. He who is intensifying energy, the unborn one, who is a very dense mass, who is hidden in the garland of knots, the embodiment, who follows the embodied form, ... piercing the knot together with the bond, abandoning the objects of the senses and attachment like poison, focusing their states of mind, they can see him, the God, who is devoid of [even] a small portion of the Guṇas, and who is formless light. 

[0;33;40m16.46
He whose inner self is energy, and who is hiding in the contracted place in the abode which is the hollow of the lotus [in the heart], who resembles the Moon's light, who is always hidden in the pericarp among the spotless petals, is, while remaining in that place, the abode of the three worlds and the home of all beings, free of bondage, the one with the crescent moon, being at the Tattva above space. 

[0;33;40m16.47
These are all the Tattvas, O Devī. The five-fold classification has been taught in short. What other topic do you wish to hear, [something] related to liberation from saṃsāra? 

Here ends the sixteenth chapter in the Vṛṣasārasaṃgraha called the Description of Spirituality.





------ CHAPTER SEVENTEEN ------




[--- The particulars of the Dharma of donation ---]

[0;33;40m17.1
O God, I am satisfied. Now my doubts have been removed. Now you are a gracious supreme Lord, O Īśvara! Now I have heard FROM you the power of the fruits of merit. I wish to hear about [the types of] donation one by one. Please let me [hear about donating] food, clothes, gold, cows, land, and gold[?!]. 

[0;33;40m17.2
The Lord spoke: One should excel in donating food that is well-cooked, rich in ghee and contains pungent ingredients, well-prepared bread baked? with ghee, white sugar and molasses. 

[0;33;40m17.3
One should give meat coming from deer, birds, and water[-animals], and [the fruits of the] Banyan-tree, dried ginger (Łnāgara$), sugarcane, and roots, vegetables, sour, sweet and pungent fruits, and for drinks, milk, and cold and fragrant water. 

[0;33;40m17.4
One should give coagulated milk mixed with molasses, lotus-fibre [root?], lotus-roots, lotus-stalks, ointments accompanied by gifts, Kuśa grass (Łpavitra$), and flowers, with faith and respect, bowing down. 

[0;33;40m17.5
He goes to the world of Jagadīśvara on ae rial vehicles, together with Apsarases. He who donates food will have fun in the world of gods for a thousand years for each lump of boiled rice [that he gave]. 

[0;33;40m17.6
Descending to the human world, he will become a rich man. He will be born in a noble family and will possess all possible virtues, fame, beauty, and knowledge of all the arts. He will be rich together with his wife and sons. 

[0;33;40m17.7
One should donate to the poor, the miserable, the oppressed, the wretched, to those suffering of old age, to those whose share is thirst, hunger, who are without resources. By donating, one will be connected to the fruits of Dharma. 

[0;33;40m17.8
[From among aspects such as] the place, the time and the recipient of the Dharma of donation etc., the fruits are the least significant. For surely those who count on the fruits [of their actions] practise the Dharmas of trade. The Dharma of such a person will not be spotless. 

[0;33;40m17.9
He should give cool, nice-smelling and scented water [in] a light waterpot[?] filled up to the brim. He will go to the world of the Lord of Waters (Łsalileśvara$) [i.e. Varuṇa] and will not be overcome by thirst thoroughout seven births. 




[--- Donation of clothes etc. ---]

[0;33;40m17.10
He who donates a beautiful pair of sandals, polished with oil, to a Brahmin will go to the world of the king of the immortal ones [i.e. Indra], and will not approach Yama's abode through a difficult path. 

[0;33;40m17.11
When his merits fade away, he will be born again in this world into a noble family. He will be abounding with wealth, will be a king, seated on a throne on a chariot, a horse, or an elephant. 

[0;33;40m17.12
By donating clothes, O Devī, they will become most beautiful people, with knowledge of all the arts, endowed with riches, beauty, and virtues, after they have descended from heaven. 

[0;33;40m17.13
I shall then praise further the man who engages in the donation of clothes. Clothes are to be honoured in the worlds, clothes are to be held in extremely high esteem by people. 

[0;33;40m17.14
[If] clothes are in abundance, there is no respect,[?] [only] contempt and extreme disgust. Therefore clothes should always be donated, [and by this come] fame, fortune, heaven, and endless profit. 

[0;33;40m17.15
He will stay in Somaloka for as many ae ons as there are threads in the clothes [donated]. Because his merits fade away, he is reborn in the human world, with an abundance of clothes and having a lot of riches and corn. They will be beautiful, attractive, and glorious demigods (Łvidyādhara$), and [they will obtain] supremacy over the world. 

[0;33;40m17.16
One should donate well-made parasols to Brahmins which protect them from rain and sunlight, and are firm and nice. It will no doubt protect [them] from charcoal, [molten] tin, knives, etc. rain[ing down on them] on their way to Yama['s abode in hell]. 

[0;33;40m17.17
He will go to the heaven of the chief of the planets [i.e. the Sun] at the time of his death to stay for millions of years. They will be born as humans in the human world in a superb house, and they will be governors. 

[0;33;40m17.18
He who builds and donates a hut to a Brahmin, filling it with pure goods, will go to the abode of the king of the gods [i.e. Indra] at pleasure [to stay] for millions of years, in divine calculation [i.e. counted in divine years]. 

[0;33;40m17.19
After that, when they are born into a human existence, they become the kings of the seven worlds. They will be endowed with seven triads of gems[?], having excessive strength, performing thousands of sacrifices. 




[--- Donation of land ---]

[0;33;40m17.20
He who donates to a poor and distressed Brahmin land that yields plenty of corn and is in the vicinity of water will go to the world of the king of the immortal ones [i.e. of Indra] on a fascinating ae rial vehicle. 

[0;33;40m17.21
[He will experience] never-experienced enjoyments for the period of a Manu era. After that he descends to the human world. He will become the king of the Jambu continent, possessing valour, the overlord of thousands of kings. 




[--- Donation of cows ---]

[0;33;40m17.22
Those who give a cow to a Brahmin, along with its calf and milk, one that has been dressed up and has bells, one that has gold on the tip of its horns, one that yields milk, one that has been embellished, will go to the world of cows. 

[0;33;40m17.23
They will experience enjoyments for that many ae ons as there are hairs on the cow. Then they will descend to the human world and will become noble rulers controlling a thousand kings. 




[--- Donation of gold etc. ---]

[0;33;40m17.24
If one gives golden, brass, iron, or silver objects, copper, coral, gems, pearls, etc., to Brahmins, one will live through 150 million years in the world of the Vasus and Sādhyas. 

[0;33;40m17.25
Having enjoyed the divine worlds in due order, according to his wishes, he will descend to the human world and will be a king. He will be extremely difficult to defeat and will be capable to defeat thousands of Śakras [Indras]. Also, [he will have] a very long life and heroism. 




[--- Miscellaneous topics ---]

[0;33;40m17.26
He who facilitates staging spectacles [for people] to see will obtain the fruits of being handsome and attractive. By eating grass, roots and fruits, one will obtain kingdoms that have no enemies. 

[0;33;40m17.27
He who feeds on leaves will obtain a stay in heaven. By using only milk/water, [he will get] to the divine world. And he who is always [engaged] in obedience towards the guru will be born as a demigod (Łvidyādhara$) in the human world. 

[0;33;40m17.28
Should one give food, a handful of grass, to cows, one will be reborn in the human world possessing an abundancy of cows. By giving [food] to a Brahmin [after] a Śrāddha ritual piously, [his] lineage will be rich until the end of the ae on. 

[0;33;40m17.29
He who refrains from violence will have a long life. By being initiated, he will have a high-class family. He who performs a bath thrice [a day will have] a kingdom. He who drinks [only] air [i.e. fasts] will be the lord of the thirty [gods]. 

[0;33;40m17.30
The fruit of not eating is in Īśaloka. One whose habit is to give water will have satisfaction. A man who gives food will be rich; he will fulfil all his desires in this world. 

[0;33;40m17.31
He who enters the fire with a trusting mind will go to the world of the Grandfather [i.e. Brahmā]. And if a virtuous person speaks the truth, he will rejoice, O Devī, together with Apsarases. 

[0;33;40m17.32
As for someone who completely gives up the six flavours, a virtuous woman (Łsādhvī$) will obtain excessive prettiness. One can obtain matchless enjoyments by donating. By chastity, one can have a long life. 

[0;33;40m17.33
Those who perform meritorious acts will have an abundance of wealth. By observing silence, one can exercise inviolable command. He who practises austerities will fulfil his desires. One will obtain fame, glory, heaven, endless enjoyments, longevity, beauty, health, wealth, sovereignty, knowledge, etc., by asceticism. 

[0;33;40m17.34
Śakra [i.e. Indra] became the ruler of the three worlds by doing arduous penance. The king of the Yakṣas [i.e. Kubera], too: [by] the power of [his] austerities mighty sovereignty arose over the Guhya[ka]s. The king of the Rakṣas, Vibhīṣaṇa [Rāvaṇa's brother] also gained immortality merely by penance. Nandin became one of the Gaṇas as the fruit of [his] penance: focusing on the worship of Rudra. 

[0;33;40m17.35
Viṣṇu proclaimed that the penance of Brahmins was knowledge. Sūrya taught that the penance of Kṣatriyas was protection. Vāyu said that the penance of Vaiśyas was accumulating [wealth]. With regards to Śūdras, Indra taught handicraft as penance. 

[0;33;40m17.36
Prowess in battle is regarded as proper worship for Kṣatriyas. With regards to Vaiśyas, fire-oblation is said to be worship. Service is regarded as worship for Śūdras. The Brahmins' worship is recitation... ? 




[--- Donation of one's own flesh and blood, son and wife ---]

[0;33;40m17.37
Devī spoke: Are one's own flesh and blood and one's son and wife praised as donation, O Mahādeva? Tell me the truth please. 

[0;33;40m17.38
Maheśvara spoke: The wise praise one's own flesh and blood as donation. Let us hear the old legends. I shall relate them in brief. 

[0;33;40m17.39
Uśīnara, the royal saint, by giving up his own body to save a dove, focusing on others for a higher aim, reached heaven.

[--- Eight kinds of donation ---]

[0;33;40m18.2
Maheśvara spoke: He who regularly gives food to the poor and to the ones afflicted by pain will experience enjoyments in Īśaloka together with Apsarases for millions of years, before he returns to the world of mortals, his merits having worn away. 

[0;33;40m18.3
[These] men will be [re-]born in divine families, [later] having a wife and wealth and many servants, into families that are stuffed with wealth that consists of cows, horses, jewels etc., he himself possessing shining beauty and loveliness.

He who donates wells, fountains, or lotus-ponds will reach the world of Jaleśvara [i.e. Varuṇa]. Then descending from that world, he will be [re-]born into a very comfortable [well-to-do? happy? tarpaṇa?] family, and will be happy. 

[0;33;40m18.6
By donating as little gold as a cubit[?], people can reach the world of Surendra [i.e. Indra]. The characteristic marks of those who descend from there to the world of mortals is prosperity, wealth, crops, and good fortune. 

[0;33;40m18.7
By donating an excellent piece of land to a Brahmin without corruption[? adūṣita° ?], one will reach the world of Sureśvara [Śiva/Brahmā?]. After experiencing enjoyments, he descends to the world of mortals, And the characteristic mark [will be] that he will obtain the rank of `lord of the land.'

The characteristic marks of those who have been in heaven are: an abundance of wealth, grace, the attainment of happiness and enjoyment, [a long] life, fame, beauty, wife, sons, success, power, family, glory, and riches. 




[--- Marks of those who return from hell ---]

[0;33;40m18.11
I have taught you the eight supreme kinds of donation, the characteristic marks, and the [corresponding] worlds in brief. Listen, O Goddess, to the characteristic marks of those who have returned from hell, and to their actions and the fruition [thereof]. 

[0;33;40m18.12
If one kills a Brahmin, [even if only] mentally or verbally, one goes to the boundaries of terrible hell. Gradually experiencing [his karmas] for eighty ae on in hell, he will [live] as an animal for millions [of years/lives/ae ons]. 

[0;33;40m18.13
Those men will be [re-]born as ignorant, will live on the fringes of town, and will lack a good family and wealth. They will always be tormented by consumption (Łkṣayaroga$). These are the characteristic marks of one who takes away the life of a Brahmin. 

[0;33;40m18.14
If a Brahmin (Łdvija$) drinks alcohol no doubt intentionally, smells [its] odour on his own accord, he will go to the terrible and unbearable hell for ten ae ons, experiencing [his karmas] there. 

[0;33;40m18.15
Experiencing all the pain of animal existence, he will, with great difficulty, [reach] a human birth. He will go through [states of being] a Caṇḍāla, a butcher, and a dog-cooker. In this case, the characteristic mark is that his palate becomes black. 

[0;33;40m18.16
Those who despise the Vedas will [be reborn] with their tongues ... He who gives false testimony will [be reborn] blind[? CHECK]. [In case of] the murder of a friend, [one will experience] a hundred deaths in the womb. Those who eat forbidden food will eat [only] leftovers [in their next lives]. 

[0;33;40m18.17
Those wicked people who steal will, because of this sinful crime, go to hell. Suffering pain for many[?] a Manu-era, one will again and again, for hundreds of times, experience animal existence.

[0;33;40m18.24
Those who steal wheat, rice, barley, mungo beans, wild beans, or lentils, will die. If somebody, being sick with desire, sexually approaches his mother, his mother's daughter, his mother's sister, or the wife of a maternal uncle, 

[0;33;40m18.25
or if he has sex with a royal consort, his son's daughter, a daughter-in-law, a female religious mendicant, a Brahmin's wife, or a low-born woman, a goat, horse, sheep, or a cow, with a foolish mind, 

[0;33;40m18.26
he will go to the painful and extremely terrible hell. Wandering [through transmigration] a million times, dying as an animal again and again a hundred times, he will, with great difficulty, be born into a human existence, 

[0;33;40m18.27
and lacking some limbs and having a miserable body. He who had sex with his mother will have no penis; one who has sex with his mother's sister will have a damaged penis; he who enjoys his son's daughter will have a non-functional[?] penis.

[0;33;40m18.34
He who touches the feet of a Brahmin with his foot, one will have rheumatism in his feet. He who touches a cow with his feet, will have various kinds of foot-diseases. 

[0;33;40m18.35
If someone kicks his mother with his foot, worms will settle in his feet. If a wicked person touches his father with his foot, his feet will be swollen and moist in a future life (Łparatra$). 

[0;33;40m18.36
He who touches water with his foot without paying respect will have elephantiasis in both feet. If someone touches fire with his foot, will always remain `fire-footed.'

[0;33;40m18.40

[The marks will be] ugliness, poverty, [birth] in the lowest of families, undiserable/shitty work, repulsive employment?, and livelihood, disgrace, loss of eyesight, and he will be born amongst `dog-cookers,' Ḍombas etc. 

[0;33;40m18.44
These are the characteristic marks of those sinners who have returned from hell, as seen in the human world. In brief, I have proclaimed, O Devī, how one, when one's karmas are destroyed, is liberated in this world. 

[0;33;40m18.45
The water of its torrents is mother and father; its flow is son and daughter; its underwater currents are brothers; its revolving whirlpools the wife; its winding currents the daughter-in-laws; its rising waves the relatives; its two banks Desire and Anger; the elephants and Makaras and fish and sharks are Desires; in this frightening[?] [world of transmigration] that appears as an ocean, there is no refuge from death, [and people] advance helplessly, bitten by Time (Łkāla$). 

[0;33;40m18.46
[And yet, it is] always [like this: when] the day [of] dissolution (Łpañcatva$) comes by which one perishes (Łvināśa$[Łṃ$] Łyāti$), abandoning the body [of the deceased person] in a forest, in a rough place filled with dogs and jackals, all the relatives turn back home, with their compassion gone, and only Dharma stays. Therefore one [should] cling on to Dharma and should not serve any other friends if one seeks the other world. 

Here ends the eighteenth chapter in the Vṛṣasārasaṃgraha called Marks of the Fruition of Previous Karma.





------ CHAPTER NINETEEN ------




[--- Cows ---]

[0;33;40m19.1
Vigatarāga spoke: By what action can the great Dharma, whose rituals are subtle[?], be reached? I ask for an easy method for mankind, tell me about it. 

[0;33;40m19.2
Anarthayajña spoke: I shall teach you the great Dharma that is the easy method, O Brahmin. Listen to that action by which heaven can be reached easily. 

[0;33;40m19.3
Cows are the mothers of the worlds. Cows hold all the world. All cow-dung is nectar, all are produced by Śiva's will. 

[0;33;40m19.4
Cows contain all the gods. The Brahmin contains all the gods. Earth contains all the gods. Śiva contains all the gods. 

[0;33;40m19.5
Therefore cows are always to be served because they give religious duties, liberation, financial gain and success. They should be provided with food, shelter, water, etc., with all one's effort. 

[0;33;40m19.6
One should not beat them too hard...? Protect them in thick [darkness or when in multitude], in case something is broken or they are startled. 

[0;33;40m19.7
In case of pain from disease or wound, one should apply remedy using medicine. Rubbing should be done as much as it is pleasurable for cows. 

[0;33;40m19.8
By circumabulating cows with faith and devotion, the whole Earth up to the oceans gets circulambulated. 

[0;33;40m19.9
If a man touches a cow with faith ...... his sins, be them committed at daylight or at night, will disappeat, no doubt. 

[0;33;40m19.10
He who applies the water that has been dispersed by a [cow's] tail onto his head, will have his sins accumulated throughout his life destroyed, no doubt. 

[0;33;40m19.11
One should bathe the cows as prescribed, using water onto which mantras have been recited. If he himself bathes in the same water, he will have all his sins destroyed. 

[0;33;40m19.12
Diseases, obstructing forces, and bad luck will disappear instantly. Those with dead offspring or without offspring praise this very bath. 

[0;33;40m19.13
If a man collects the `horn-water' of cows and applies it on his head, he will receive the fruits of bathing at all the sacred pilgrimage places. 

[0;33;40m19.14
If somebody gives a handful of food to cows with devotion, by this an Agnihotra is being performed and all the gods become satisfied. 

[0;33;40m19.15
He who collects on his head the four streams [of milk] from the teats will receive the meritous fruits of visiting the four oceans. 

[0;33;40m19.16
He who gives his life for cows during an attempt at stealing them, O greatest of Brahmins will prosper in Śivaloka for millions of years. 

[0;33;40m19.17
If a man rears all [the cows] that have missing or broken [limbs] CHECK, will get all the fruits that are said to be produced by donating millions of wives[?], 

[0;33;40m19.18
and will go to Śivaloka. When descended from Śivaloka, he will become a universal monarch on Earth. 

[0;33;40m19.19
I have taught [about cows] truly, in brief, O supreme Brahmin. It is impossible to talk about the excellence of cows in more detail. 

[0;33;40m19.20
Vigatarāga spoke: The gods are of eight kinds, animals are of five kinds. Mankind is said to be only one single [kind]. How come that there is the system of four social classes (Łvarṇa$)? 

[0;33;40m19.21
Anarthayajña spoke: It [i.e. the system of four social classes] was created by Lord Viṣṇu in the previous ae on[s].  Before the very beginning of all ae ons, there was a single class (Łvarṇa$) of Brahmins (Łdvija$). 

[0;33;40m19.22
The Brahmins (Łvipra$) got to know all the Vedas and all the sacrifices. These thousands of Brahmins (Łvipra$) developed an inclination to make a resolution to perform sacrifices. 

[0;33;40m19.23
Having understood the intention of the thousands of senior Brahmins (Łvipra$), the Brahmins (Łbrāhmaṇa$) commenced performing rituals (Łkarman$) and the tasks (Łkarman$) were distributed. 

[0;33;40m19.24
Some took on the function of being priests (Łṛtvij$), some took on the task of protection. Some got engaged in the acquisition of materials and others were appointed to do manual crafts. 

[0;33;40m19.25
This is how they started performing sacrifices in the beginning. With the tasks (Łkarman$) thus distributed, the will to perform sacrifices increased. 

[0;33;40m19.26
Then came all the Ṛṣis and all the gods and the Ancestors. They discussed it among themselves, the divine Ṛṣis, the Ancestors and the gods. 

[0;33;40m19.27
Brahmā/Viṣṇu (Łvidhi$) created class for the sake of sacrifice. [The classes are] for the purpose of rituals (Łkratu$). Proceed in this very manner, Sirs, O excellent twice-born! 

[0;33;40m19.28
Those Brahmins (Łbrāhmaṇa$) who are now engaged in sacrifice and recitation, those good Brahmins (Łsuvipra$) shall become Brahmins (Łvipratāṃ yāntu$), always engaged in the six duties [of Brahmins] (Łṣaṭkarman$). 

[0;33;40m19.29
As for those Brahmins (Łvipra$) that have been appointed to protect [the sacrifice] with weapons in their hands, to protect the Brāhmins (Łvipra$) from injury, they shall eternally follow[?] the vow of Kṣatras. 

[0;33;40m19.30
As for those twice-born who have been appointed for the acquisition of materials, they shall become Vaiśyas, involved in the means of trade. 

[0;33;40m19.31
Those of the twice-born who have been appointed to the tasks of slaughering and tying [animals] and of manual skills, they all shall become Śūdras. 

[0;33;40m19.32
The [world] of Prajāpati belongs to the Brahmins (Łbrāhmaṇa$) [after death] because they are devoted to the sacrifice and to recitation. The [world] of Indra belongs to the Kṣatriyas because they are devoted to the protection of the people. 

[0;33;40m19.33
The [world] of Vāsus belongs to the Vaiśyas who earn their living by trade and agriculture. The [world] of Marut belongs to the Śūdras who devote themselves to sevice. 

[0;33;40m19.34
Understanding the intention of the great Ṛṣis, the Ancestors and the gods, lotus-born Brahmā, the Grandfather, it [i.e. the system of Łvarṇa$s] was established firmly. 

[0;33;40m19.35
All the main domestic animals, birds and wild animals that are born in the world, 

[0;33;40m19.36
CHECK .... [The social classes] have been taught briefly. What else do you wish to hear? 

[0;33;40m19.38
Anarthayajña spoke: The Brahmins's penance is knowledge. The Kṣatriya's penance is protection. The Vaiśya's penance is business (Łvārttā$). The Śudra's penance is service. 

[0;33;40m19.39
The Brahmin's wealth is the acceptance of gifts. The Kṣatriya's wealth is his bow. The Vaiśya's wealth is agriculture. The Śūdra's wealth is obedience. 

[0;33;40m19.40
Undertaking is the Kṣatriya's worship. Fire-oblation is the Vaiśya's worship. Service is the Śūdra's worship. Recitation is the Brahmin's worship. 

[0;33;40m19.41
Truth is the pilgrimage place for Brahmins. A battle is a pilgrimage place for Kṣatriyas. Āryā[varta?] is the pilgrimage place for Vaiśyas. The Brahmins are the pilgrimage place of Śūdras. 

[0;33;40m19.42
There is no friend comparable to knowledge. There is no companion comparable to donation. There is no relative comparable to knowledge. There is no worship comparable to recitation. 

[0;33;40m19.43
A person without Dharma is similar to the dead. Someone who conquers his senses is similar to the gods. One who gives protection is similar to worship. Who [reaches the state of] mind-nonmind (Łmanonmana$) becomes similar to Śiva. 

[0;33;40m19.44
Vigatarāga spoke: Donation, worship, penance, pilgrimages, renunciation, and yoga: which is the best among these? 

[0;33;40m19.45
Anarthayajña spoke: He who worships with sacrifices is better than a thousand whose Dharma is donation. He who visits pilgrimages places is better than a thousand who worship with sacrifices. 

[0;33;40m19.46
He who is devoted to penance is better than a thousand who visit pilgrimages places. He who is a renunciate is better than a thousand who are devoted to penance. 

[0;33;40m19.47
He who controls his senses is better than a thousand renunciates. He who practises yoga is better than a thousand who control their senses. 

[0;33;40m19.48
He whose mind has dissolved is better that a thousand who practise yoga. Therefore one should first purify the mind by all means. 

[0;33;40m19.49
He who controls all his senses can reach heaven and liberation. If all the senses are let loose, what one achieves is the hell of animal existence. 

[0;33;40m19.50
Vigatarāga spoke: From amongst the moving and unmoving living beings, which is said to be the best? Tell me this now, please cut my doubts. 

[0;33;40m19.51
Anarthayajña spoke: From amongst the moving and unmoving living beings, the moving ones are taught to be the best. From amongst the moving ones, the sentient ones (Łbuddhimat$) are said to be the best. 

[0;33;40m19.52
Among all the sentient ones then humans are the best. The best of all humans is said to be the Brahmin. 

[0;33;40m19.53
Among all the Brahmins, the scholar (Łvidvat$) is the best. From amongst all the scholars, the one who knows his religios duties (Łkṛtabuddhi$) is the best. 

[0;33;40m19.54
From amongst all those who know their religios duties, the performer [of rituals] (Łkartṛ$) is the best. And amongst the performers [of rituals] the one who knows the Vedic mantras (Łbrahmavedin$) is eminent. 

[0;33;40m19.55
The knower of Vedic mantras is the best Brahmin. I do not know of any other penance[?]. He is the real Brahmin, the real ascetic, the real yogin, he is said to be Śiva. 

Here ends the nineteenth chapter in the Vṛṣasārasaṃgraha called The particulars of donation and worship.





------ CHAPTER TWENTY ------

[0;33;40m20.1
Vigatarāga spoke: I would like to learn about the twenty-five Tattvas truely. Teach me now so that my doubts could be dispelled. 




[--- Explaining the Tattvas ---]

[0;33;40m20.2
Anarthayajña spoke: How can you possibly ask me to reveal everything as directly visible? [But] I made a decision that [whenever being] questioned, I am to speak. Listen, I shall teach you the supreme essence of the reality levels/principles (Łtattva$). 




[--- The Puruṣa/Śiva/Brahmā (25th) ---]

[0;33;40m20.3
That which has no beginning, no middle part and no end, and is not to be known even by the gods, that which is extremely subtle and extremely large, supportless and spotless,

inconceivable, immeasurable, imperishable, devoid of syllables, that which is everything and everywhere and that which is pervasive, and exists covering everything.

It appears to have the qualities of all the sense faculties but is devoid of all sense faculties. It is not subject to ageing, it is immortal and unborn. It is peaceful, it is the supreme soul, it is undecaying Śiva. 

[0;33;40m20.6
It is characterised by being unobservable, it is self-abiding, it is Brahmā, it is called Puruṣa. It is to be known as the twenty-fifth [Tattva], the Lord (Łprabhu$) who destroys death and rebirth. 

[0;33;40m20.7
He is free of the stain of having parts[?], and is devoid of the fifty voids. As a waterbird is not stained by the water while swimming in it, similarly [the Puruṣa] is not stained even by hundreds of sinful acts. 




[--- Prakṛti (24th) ---]

[0;33;40m20.8
Know the twenty-fourth Tattva certainly as Prakṛti. It is in fact to be known as Vikṛti (`Modification') by the wise. 

[0;33;40m20.9
All [the other Tattvas below Prakṛti], Buddhi, Ahaṃkāra etc. originate in Prakṛti. Earth etc. [up to Buddhi] dissolve in Vikṛti one by one. 




[--- Mati (Buddhi, intelligence, 23rd) ---]

[0;33;40m20.10
The Intelligence (Łmatitattva$ [= Buddhi]) is the twenty-third. It possesses qualities such as dharmic. Know it as the perceiver of the soul, produced by an abundance of Sattva. 




[--- Ahaṃkāra (egoity, individualization, 22nd) ---]

[0;33;40m20.11
The twenty-second Tattva is Ahaṃkāra according to the wise. [This is the Tattva that] says: `The five [gross elements] etc. are mine!' It is produced by an abundance of Rajas. 




[--- Space (hollowness) and Sound (21st--20th) ---]

[0;33;40m20.12
Know the twenty-first Tattva as Hollowness (Łsuṣira$) [= Łākāśa$], O Brahmin. Hollowness is beyond Sound [but] it is characterised by the quality of Sound. 

[0;33;40m20.13
The seven [diatonic musical] notes (Łsvara$), the three basic scales (Łgrāma$), and the twenty-one modal scales (Łmūrchana$); the forty-nine hexatonic and pentatonic scales (Łtāna$): the classification of Sound includes these and other [classes]. 

[0;33;40m20.14
These and many other are the classes of sounds, O Brahmin. [This] has been declared by the experts on musical notes. 

[0;33;40m20.15
[Other sounds include] the sounds of flutes, tambourines, lutes, kettle-drums, conch-shells, bass-drums and gongs. 

[0;33;40m20.16
Listen, O excellent Brahmin, I shall teach you the ten elements (Łdhātu$) of space. [Space is present in the following ten bodily locations:] the anus, the sexual organs, the stomach, the neck, the two ears[?], the mouth, the two nostrils, 

[0;33;40m20.17
and the tenth, the [cavity of the] heart. The body originates in space. Next I shall teach you something else. Listen to it, O excellent Brahmin. 

[0;33;40m20.18
Ten element-guṇas (Łdhātuguṇa$) are to be known for each of the five elements (Łbhūta$). The qualities of Space are Sound, pervasion and `perforatedness' [being pervaded], 

[0;33;40m20.19
its being supportless, independent and unmanifest, invariableness, not being restrainable, being an element, and ..., [?]. 




[--- Wind and Touch (19th--18th) ---]

[0;33;40m20.20
The birth of Wind is then from the Space Łdhātu$. Together with the previous Sound Łguṇa$, Wind has Touch as its guṇa. 

[0;33;40m20.21
I have already described Sound, listen to Touch, O excellent Brahmin. Hard, smooth, slippery, soft, sticky, sharp, fluid, 

[0;33;40m20.22
rough, rugged, pointed[?], cold, hot: these are [the] twelve [Łvāyuguṇa$s]. It is the body that senses both pleasant and unpleasant touches. 

[0;33;40m20.23
Prāṇa, Apāna, Samāna, Udāna and Vyāna, Nāga, Kūrma, Kṛkara, Devadatta, Dhanaṃjaya: 

[0;33;40m20.24
These are said to be the ten main Winds, O excellent Brahmin. Dhanaṃjaya is [responsible for] noise, Devadatta [for] yawning, 

[0;33;40m20.25
Kṛkara constantly causes hunger, Kūrma is [is responsible for] the opening of the eyes. Nāga constantly opens [up things] and nourishes, O Brahmin. 

[0;33;40m20.26
Prāṇa makes living beings inhale and exhale. It is called Prāṇa because it sets [beings] in motion (Łprayāṇaṃ kurute$). 

[0;33;40m20.27
Apāna takes people's[?] food down. It gets rid of semen and urine, that is why it is called Apāna [the 'down and out' Wind]. 

[0;33;40m20.28
The Wind called Samāna brings into equilibrium that which has been drunk, the food that has been eaten, the blood [and the three humours] Pitta, Kapha and Anila. 

[0;33;40m20.29
The Wind called Udāna causes the lower lip and the mouth to tremble, it irritates the eyes and the limbs and it disturbs the vital organs. 

[0;33;40m20.30
Vyāna bends the limbs, [it makes the body] deformed, [it causes] illness and irritaion. It is said to destroy pleasure ... is called Vyāna. 

[0;33;40m20.31
[Everything] concerning the section on the ten Winds has been taught by me, O excellent Brahmin. [Now] listen as I teach you the ten other Łguṇa$s of Wind. 

[0;33;40m20.32
The Wind has [these Łguṇa$s]: unsettledness, touch, presence in speech, independence, strength, quickness, release, movement and performing actions and existence. 




[--- Fire and Form (17th-16th) ---]

[0;33;40m20.33
Fire is created by Wind. Its Łguṇa$ is Form. There are three guṇas of Fire together with Sound and Touch. 

[0;33;40m20.34
Sound and Touch have been discussed before, therefore [now] hear about the Form guṇa. Short, tall, minute, gross and circular, 

[0;33;40m20.35
square, ???, triangle and hexagon. Light, dark, red, blue, yellow, brown, 

[0;33;40m20.36
dark-blue, golden, deep-brown: these are the nine colours. The ninefold guṇas of the nine colours make up 81. 

[0;33;40m20.37
I am telling you the ten Fire dhātus, listen and be attentive. Desire, heat, sight, anger, the digestive fire as the fifth, 

[0;33;40m20.38
knowledge, yoga, penance, meditation, the fire of the universe[?] as the tenth. I shall teach you the other ten Łguṇa$s of Fire, O excellent Brahmin. 

[0;33;40m20.39
Fire has [the following qualities:] unconquerable, ..., splendour, heat, cooking, illuminating, purity, passion, lightness, sharpness and the tenth, tending upwards. 




[--- Water and Taste (15th--14th) ---]

[0;33;40m20.40
Water is produced from Fire and has Taste as its Łguṇa$. The wise know Water as having four Łguṇa$s: 

[0;33;40m20.41
Sound, Touch, Form, and the fourth, Taste. The Łguṇa$s Form etc. have been taught. Listen to Taste now. 

[0;33;40m20.42
The wise teach that the six tastes are: pungent, bitter, astringent, salty, sour, and sweet. 

[0;33;40m20.43
[These] six tastes have six kinds and thus become thirty-six Łguṇa$s. I shall teach you the other ten Łdhātu$s of Water, listen to me. 

[0;33;40m20.44
Saliva, mucus, the phlegmatic humour, blood, bile, phlegm, sweat, tears, chyle, and the tenth, fat. 

[0;33;40m20.45
I shall teach you the ten Łguṇa$s of Water, listen to me. From Water [come] coldness, liquidity, wetness, fluidity, oiliness, the tongue, dripping, earthiness, wateriness, and flowing. 




[--- Earth and Smell (13rd--12th) ---]

[0;33;40m20.46
Water produced Earth. Its Łguṇa$ is said to be Smell. Taking the four Łguṇa$s of Water, Earth has [the additional] Łguṇa$ Taste: 

[0;33;40m20.47
Sound, Touch, Form, Taste, and the fifth, Smell. The Łguṇa$s of Water have been taught. Now listen to the Smell-Łguṇa$s of Earth. 

[0;33;40m20.48
Smells are pleasant or unpleasant, fragrant and stinking. Pleasant smells are camphor, musk, sandalwood, and Aloe, 

[0;33;40m20.49
saffron and other fragrant substances. Unleasant smells are the smell of urine, fae ces and sweat, unbearably bad breath, withered and decaying[?] smells.

[0;33;40m20.52
O Brahmin, I have taught you in a complete form the various Łguṇa$s and Łdhātu$s and [their] origin as I heard it before. 




[--- Sense capacities and action capacities (11th--2nd) ---]

[0;33;40m20.53
The Ahaṃkāra is subject to modification and because of an abundance of Sattva [in it], it is Sāttvika. Ear, skin, eyes, tongue, and the fifth, nose: 

[0;33;40m20.54
these are the five sense capacities (Łbuddhīndriya$), O great Brahmin. Hands, feet, anus, the sexual organs, and the fifth, speech[: these are the organs of action (Łkarmendriya$).] 

[0;33;40m20.55
The ear perceives the various sounds, O great Brahmin, those of flutes and lutes, and of various kinds of strings, 

[0;33;40m20.56

[0;33;40m20.64
Smell is perceived by the Nose. Smell can be pleasant or unpleasant, O chief Brahmin. The smell of molasses, clarified butter, bdellium, ashes, sandalwood, Aloe, musk, saffron, etc., is pleasant and charming. 

[0;33;40m20.65
The bad smell of wounds, urine and fae ces, rotten meat, fart, etc., is said to be unpleasant. 

[0;33;40m20.66
One performs various actions with the hands, O great Brahmin, those related to earth (Łmāhendra$), water (Łvāruṇa$), air (Łvāyavya$), and fire (Łāgneya$). 

[0;33;40m20.67
Those related to fire are: cooking, etc., [working with] copper, iron, and tin, various fire-rituals, and rituals of fire-worship. 

[0;33;40m20.68
[Acts moving] air with a winnowing fan, one's breath, a chowrie or parchment, or a pankha, are the ones related to air. 

[0;33;40m20.69
Those related to water perform various acts involving water: acts with flavours and secondary flavours, its [the body's?] nourishing, 

[0;33;40m20.70

[0;33;40m20.71
Various ways of vomitting [ex conj., accept msCb, or 9th?] are [also] called acts involving water. An earthly act involve various ways of working with earth, O great Brahmin. 

[0;33;40m20.72
The work of a potter, working with soil or with stones, work with wood, ivory, horns of animals, etc., are called earthly acts. The five actions of the hand have been briefly described. 

[0;33;40m20.73
The action for the feet is going in all the directions of the cardinal and intermediate point of the compass, up and down slopes, and on flat ground, on rocks, through passages, and into caves, through land flooded with water and filled with mud and covered in thorns.

[--- The mind and the non-mind (1st) ---]

[0;33;40m20.78
Now I shall teach the nine Łguṇa$s of the mind. Movement, effecting, firmness, emission, fantasy, patience, truth, untruth, and quickness are the nine Łguṇa$s of the mind. 

[0;33;40m20.79
[The five Łguṇa$s of the mind, or intelligence, include] pleasant and unpleasant notions, intention and being united. The form of the Mind is twofold: mind and non-mind. 

[0;33;40m20.80
It is mind when there are sense faculties, and non-mind when there are no senses. When [the senses] are controlled, liberation is produced. When they are let go, bondage is produced. 

[0;33;40m20.81
If the senses are under control, it means reaching heaven and liberation. When the senses are let loose, suffering and transmigration are the result. 

[0;33;40m20.82
The wise know that the mind can be form-endowed (Łsakala$) and formless (Łniṣkala$). When there is multiplicity (Łnānātva$), the mind is form-endowed (Łsakala$). When there is oneness, the mind is formless (Łniṣkala$). 

[0;33;40m20.83
Vigatarāga spoke: The mind is self-evident for people, but the non-mind (Łunmanas$) is not known. Teach us about the non-mind, what is its defining mark? 

[0;33;40m20.84
Anarthayajña spoke: Hear the ten chacteristic marks of someone who has entered the state of the non-mind, O Brahmin. His ears do not hear any sound, not even the sound of conch-shells and kettle-drums. 

[0;33;40m20.85
His skin does not know touch, not even unbearable cold or hotness. His eyes do not see any forms, not even things bigger than mountains. 

[0;33;40m20.86
His tongue does not sense tastes, not even sweetness or saltiness. His nose does not sense smells, not even strong or impure ones. 

[0;33;40m20.87
I have taught the non-mind like this. It destroys all duality [such as hot-cold], which is imperishable Niṣkala Śiva that manifests competely when one reaches the other shore of existence. 

[0;33;40m20.88
It is Śiva, highest Brahmā, highest and imperishable Viṣṇu. It is subtle, it is the highest Swan [i.e. soul], which is imperishable and devoid of decay. 

[0;33;40m20.89
Know this as the non-mind, and as Śiva, O chief of the Brahmins. I have taught you [this], what else would you like to ask? 

Here ends the twentieth chapter in the Vṛṣasārasaṃgraha called the Description of the twenty-five Tattvas.





------ CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE ------




[--- Viṣṇu reveals his true form ---]

[0;33;40m21.1
Vigatarāga spoke: ``Bravo, O best of the wise, bravo, O best of the guardians of Dharma! What self-control, what tranquillity! What a sacrifice, what penance! 

[0;33;40m21.2
By this nectar-like speech [of yours], my amazement has risen considerably. And I am pleased with the extraordinary flavour of knowledge based on penance. 

[0;33;40m21.3
What kind of boon shall I give you? Tell me. I'll give you anything you desire.'' Having heard this, [Anarthayajña] then replied with appropriate words. 

[0;33;40m21.4
[Anarthayajña spoke:] ``Who are you, O best of benefactors? Are you a god, a Dānava-demon or a Rākṣasa? Or rather [you must be] Lord Viṣṇu, who has come to test me. 

[0;33;40m21.5
I recognize you clearly, O best of men, O highest person! Display your [true] Form, O Govinda, if penance can yield fruit.'' 

[0;33;40m21.6
[Vaiśampāyana spoke:] Then lotus-eyed Hari displayed his own [true] body, holding in his hands a conch-shell, a discus and a mace, wearing yellow garments. 

[0;33;40m21.7
Seeing him, Anarthayajña was truly amazed. Thrilled by unequalled delight, his eyes filled with tears, 

[0;33;40m21.8
his voice trembling, he began speaking to Janārdana [i.e. Viṣṇu]. ``My birth and my austerities have now borne their fruits. 

[0;33;40m21.9
Obeisance to you who are the origin of man and other [living beings]! [?] Obeisance to you who are the universe! Obeisance to you who [transforming into a person? DG] Obeisance to you from whom Brahmā was born! 

[0;33;40m21.10
Obeisance to you who have a thousand heads! Obeisance to you who have a thousand eyes! Obeisance to you who have a thousand liṅgas! Obeisance to you who have a thousand chests! 

[0;33;40m21.11
Obeisance to you who have a thousand embodiments! Obeisance to you who have a thousand arms! Obeisance to you who have a thousand faces! Obeisance to you who have a thousand supernatural powers! 

[0;33;40m21.12
Obeisance to you who assumed the form of a boar! Obeisance to you who [in that form] dug out and saved the Earth! Obeisance to you who create all living beings! Obeisance to you on who are the seat of the four life-stages! 

[0;33;40m21.13
Obeisance to you who assumed the form of the Man-lion! Obeisance to you who [in that form] tore asunder the chest of Diti's son [Hiraṇyakaśipu]! Obeisance to you who destroyed the armies [conj.] of the Asuras! Obeisance to you who destroyed the Asuras' haughtiness! 

[0;33;40m21.14
Obeisance to you who tamed Diti's son [Bali?]! Obeisance to you who destroyed Bali's sacrifice! Obeisance to you of the three steps/Trivikrama! Obeisance to you who drove away the pain of the thirty gods! 

[0;33;40m21.15
Obeisance to you who are imperishable, O endless one! Obeisance to you who drive away the pain of the world! Obeisance to you who killed [the Asuras] Madhu and Kaiṭa[bha]! Obeisance to you who are the friend of the three worlds! 

[0;33;40m21.16
Obeisance to you who are the delight of the thirty gods! Obeisance to you who possess divine vision! Obeisance to you who have gone beyond the limits of existence! Obeisance to you who are worshipped by the three worlds! 

[0;33;40m21.17
Obeisance to you who hold a mace in [one of] your right[?] hand[s]! Obeisance to you who hold an excellent discus in your hand! Obeisance to you who hold a conch-shell in your hand! Obeisance to you who hold a conch-shell[? rather: lotus] in your hand! 

[0;33;40m21.18
Obeisance to you who recline on the ocean! Obeisance to you who have the form that crushed Hara [the Dānava?]! Obeisance to you whose banner has the King of Birds [Garuḍa] [on it]! Obeisance to you whose eyes are the Sun and the Moon! 

[0;33;40m21.19
Obeisance to you whose vehicle is the Enemy of Serpents [i.e. Garuḍa]! Obeisance to you who display your extraordinary form! Obeisance to you whose splendour is that of a hundred thousand suns! Obeisance to you who was, [in your Kūrma-avatāra] the firm support at the churning out of the divine nectar! 

[0;33;40m21.20
Obeisance to you who are praised in the world of immortals! Obeisance to you who are the seat of the temple of the world! Obeisance to you, the only one affectionate towards the world! Obeisance to you who bestow happiness on everyone, obeisance! 

[0;33;40m21.21
O Govinda, forgive my sin. As you were asking me very actively, I, being a wicked person, told you all this out of arrogance. Have pity on me, Lord of the thirty gods [instr.?].'' 

[0;33;40m21.22
Vaiśampāyana spoke: Keśava, the destroyer of the heroes of the enemy, was satisfied by this hymn of praise. He, the great general, replied in a ... [nirupaspṛhā/spṛhayā] voice. 

[0;33;40m21.23
I am satisfied by this hymn of praise of me, dear Sir. I am vehemently trembling [with joy]. I'll grant you any boon you desire even if it is something difficult to obtain in the three worlds. 

[0;33;40m21.24
[He who] praises me with this ....? [hymn] that you recited and which is fascinating because it contains the meaning of the Vedas, will dwell in heaven for as many ae ons as the number of syllables in it. 

[0;33;40m21.25
And you should choose a boon at your pleasure, fearlessly, beginning from sovereignty over the three worlds. Shall I grant you sovereignty over the seven-fold[?] world? Or a heap of gold? Or many girls? 

[0;33;40m21.26
Vaiśampāyana spoke: Hearing the divine boons [offered] [em. to vacam?] by the imperishable one, he bowed down to his lotus-feet. Having recognized that Viṣṇu was being most generous, with a delighted heart....[to be reconstructed] 

[0;33;40m21.27
I do not desire anything else as a gift, O God. Only (Łeka$) the essence of bondage is certain. I have been freed from this bondage by your Lordship's grace, and, O Govinda, I am delighting in Dharma. 

[0;33;40m21.28
The Lord spoke: The extent to which your mind has been enlightened is something even the great sages and the gods have never seen, [this] spotless freedom from suffering. The ocean of existence has certaily been crossed. 

[0;33;40m21.29
Well, let's go now to the White Island, which is unattainable and is inaccessible even for the gods. He who departs after his mind has been purified by his devotion towards me, will never again enter the dreadful ocean [of existence]. 

[0;33;40m21.30
Vaiśampāyana spoke: Having spoken thus, then Hari took the great ascetic by the hand, who disappeared in that moment, and with him Keśava, too. 

[0;33;40m21.31
Thus, as a consequence of the abundance of Dharma[?? in him?], he [Anarthayajña] reached world of the Highest Person, of the one who is the origin of all living beings, and who is imperishable, the eternal and never-ending [world] of the never-decaying. 

[0;33;40m21.32
You yourself should be loyal to Keśava, to Janārdana of unmeasurable heroism, so that you can tread the path of that best among the twice-born [i.e. that Brahmin], [to] that excellent person. 

[0;33;40m21.33
What else should I teach you further, O king? If you have any curiosity remaining, ask me, Sir, whatever you want regarding the future or the past, anything you wish, Sir. 

[0;33;40m21.34
Janamejaya spoke: How many kalpas have passed until now? How many are the future kalpas? How many Indras are taught to exist with regard to each ae on? Tell me one by one[???]. 

[0;33;40m21.35
Vaiśampāyana spoke: 100,000 billions of Kalpas have passed so far [rājyam? / rājan?]. There are fourteen Indras in one Kalpa, O king. The same [number applies to] Manvantaras per Kalpa. The future Kalpas are again 100,000 billion. 

[0;33;40m21.36
The first Kalpa was the Varāhakalpa. Six Manvantaras have passed, O King. Seventy-one four-fold [Mahā]yugas is the number that applies to a Manvantara. 

[0;33;40m21.37
Fourteen Manvantara-periods is one Kalpa, according to the sages. Ten thousand Kalpas is Brahmā's day. His night is [of] the same [length] according to the experts. 

[0;33;40m21.38
Six hundred-thousand Kalpas is called a [cosmic] month. Twelve of them is called a year. 

[0;33;40m21.39
Brahmā's life is said to be that year multiplied by 100,000 billions of Kalpas[?]. But even Brahmā, the Lord of the three worlds, the supreme person, is taught to be transient. Why should we grieve over the rest of the four kinds of living beings and the fate[?] of the soul? Therefore there is nothing that is untouched by the fine[?] essence of the world except for eternal Śiva. 

Here ends the twenty-first chapter in the Vṛṣasārasaṃgraha called the Description of the \ae ons.





------ CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO ------

[0;33;40m22.1
Janamejaya spoke: I have heard from [your] lotus-mouth the ultimate compendium on the essence of Dharma, in the proper way, together with the meaning of the Vedas, conveyed by sweet and polished speech. 

[0;33;40m22.2
This great essence is systematic (nyāyayukta), and it is the supreme secret knowledge. I am satisfied now having drunk the nectar of immortality that removes birth, death and disease. 

[0;33;40m22.3
I want to ask you another question, O great ascetic, the reason behind the name [of Anarthayajña]. I would like you to tell [me] about [his] Varṇa, Gotra and Āśrama. 

[0;33;40m22.4
Vaiśampāyana spoke: Listen, O King, attentively. I shall tell you about the Āśrama, the Varṇa and the Jāti of the great and noble yogin, O king. 

[0;33;40m22.5
In the southern region of the Himālaya, on the Mṛgendra peak, O king, on the banks of the river Mahendrapathagā[?], O King, 

[0;33;40m22.6
there was his hermitage. The illustrous one lived on the beautiful banks [of the river], having reached the other shore of Truth, free from desire, 

[0;33;40m22.7
leading a moral and pure life, with all opposites [such as happiness and pain] and weakness conquered, with his arrogance, fear, and anger conquered, with his greediness completely conquered. 

[0;33;40m22.8
The Kṣatriyas born in the Soma clan became twice-born [Brahmins]. Because of [the] penance [they performed], [and because of their] discipline and good conduct, Viṣṇu turned them into twice-born [Brahmins]. 

[0;33;40m22.9
They had been called Ajitas, [and] the one who conquered lust and anger [transformed them]. O great King, I shall tell you about his vow, listen. 

[0;33;40m22.10
I am flourishing in the town of the Spirit, which is[?] populated by Matter[?], in the vicinity of the divine realm[?], the ten abodes and the five [phps Sāṃkhyatattvas??]. 

[0;33;40m22.11
The vow of ten sacrifices was observed and he conquered the ten desires. He followed the ten Niyama-rules. The ten winds were his priest. 

[0;33;40m22.12
With the ten-syllable mantra, he was at the level of the ten Dharmic rituals[???]. His ten sense faculties had the energy of the flames in the [sacrificial] fire lit by the ten saṃyamas. 

[0;33;40m22.13
He practised the ten yogic sitting positions and focused on the ten ways of meditation. His intellect was his altar, his mind the sacrificial post, and Soma consumption was the immortal syllable. 

[0;33;40m22.14
The priestly fee was fearlessness offered to living beings, the tying of the sacrificial animal was performed on[?] himself. He spent his time performing immaterial sacrifice [thus]. The sages, who know the truth, call him Anarthayajña. 

[0;33;40m22.15
Janamejaya spoke: Please let me hear about the ten sacrifices, O best of Brahmins, and about the ten desires and the ten kinds of meditation, the ten yogas and the ten-syllable [mantra]. 

[0;33;40m22.16
Vaiśampāyana spoke: Sacrifice to/with the Brahman [?; = Vedic offering at <i>saṃdhyā</i>], to the Devas, the Ancestors, the Ghosts, the Guests, recitation, yoga, penance, meditation and [Vedic?] study: these are the ten [sacrifices]. 

[0;33;40m22.17
Wife, son, cattle, servant, wealth, grain, fame, beauty, respect, and enjoyment as the tenth, O king: the ten desires have been taught. 

[0;33;40m22.18
Mental, simultaneous and condensed [yoga], O king, and the yoga named Viśālā, and also the one known as Dvikaraṇa, 

[0;33;40m22.19
sun, moon, fire, crystal and sky. Always sitting in [one of] the ten yoga positions, the great ascetic, 

[0;33;40m22.20
when his mind is still not under control, should visualize the subtle one. This is mental yoga. When he can control his mind with breath-control, that is called simultaneous [yoga]. 

[0;33;40m22.21
He should visualize the universe with all its moving and motionless [animate and inanimate] parts, from Brahmā to a tuft of grass, as gradually dissolving, and should reflect upon the subtle one: 

[0;33;40m22.22
this is called condensed [yoga]. Now listen to the Viśālā. The wise one should call to mind [everything] from Brahmā to the subtle. 

[0;33;40m22.23
He should visualize both the condensed and the Viśālā mutually [one after the other? DG]: this is the yoga method called Dvikaraṇī. 

[0;33;40m22.24
He should imagine his heart in the center of his body, and that there is a lotus in his heart. In the center of the lotus, know that there is a pericarp, O king. 

[0;33;40m22.25
The wise ones know that there are five dots in the center of the pericarp: the sun, the moon, the flame, the crystal and the sky. 

[0;33;40m22.26
He should visualize the disk of the moon in the centre of the sun. In the centre of that [i.e. the moon], he should visualize fire that blazes without smoke. 

[0;33;40m22.27
In the centre of the fire, he should visualize a gem which has the splendour of a jet of clear water. In its center, he should visualize the sky, subtle and imperishable Śiva. 

[0;33;40m22.28
This is how I taught you the ten yogas, O king. The ten ways of meditation are taught in short as here follows, listen. 

[0;33;40m22.29
Sound, yellow, lightning, Candramālinī, moon, pleasing, well-done, 

[0;33;40m22.30
Saumyā, spotless and supportless. [1] Putting[?] two fingers in his ears, one can hear[!] sounds. 

[0;33;40m22.31
Having heard this and that syllable, he is fit for immortality. [2] He should continuously visualize yellow, smokeless[?] flames tirelessly. 

[0;33;40m22.32
He will be freed of all his sins and will reach the level without opposites. [3] The lightning in the middle of the night marks the unborn of no diseases. 

[0;33;40m22.33
After five months of continuous practice, men will develop divine sight. [4] Then he should visualize the Bindumālā [Candramālā??] which rests in the shadow of a tree. 

[0;33;40m22.34
[5] Seeing it as genuine crystal, he is liberated from the fetters. [6] He should visualize the Pleasing one ... ? pressing it in the eye. 

[0;33;40m22.35
When he sees the white and yellow and red drop, he will not be born again. These are the six ways of meditation, the Pleasing one and the others, as I taught them to you. 

[0;33;40m22.36
Now I shall teach you another thing: the fourfold supreme atom. O supreme sovereign, listen to the characteristics of that[?] by which the whole world, made up of the four elements (Łbhūta$), Earth etc., is pervaded. I shall tell you [about them] now. 

[0;33;40m22.37
The subtle atom of Earth tends upwards, O king. The pure one should observe the meditation that is direct perception firmly. 

[0;33;40m22.38
He will be freed from all his sins, as the Moon is from Rāhu. The yogin who constantly practises by this [method] is the lord of the world. 

[0;33;40m22.39
The atom of Water tends downwards, O great king. If one practises this, O king, there will be a destruction of all his sins. 

[0;33;40m22.40
The atoms? of Fire tend upwards and horizontally. He who constantly meditates upon this will reach the supreme path. 

[0;33;40m22.41
The atoms of Air tend downwards and horizontally. [If] he is not perplexed when seeing this, he is Hanumān, O king. 

[0;33;40m22.42
[If] he perceives these four [types of] atoms, O king, by this he has sacrificed with all sacrifices, by this penance is completed. 

[0;33;40m22.43
By this the whole Earth with its surrounding seven seas is given [as a sacrificial fee], and he will have received all consecrations at the sacred places and all the religious vows and rituals will have been completed. 

[0;33;40m22.44
If one practises the ten meditations by this method, O king, uninterruptedly, it will yield all the desired fruits. 

[0;33;40m22.45
O great king, I shall teach you in brief the ten-syllable [mantra] of that great-souled yogin king [Anarthayajña]. Listen attentively. 

Here ends the twenty-third chapter in the Vṛṣasārasaṃgraha.





------ CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR ------

[0;33;40m24.1
The first three sounds are Łpraṇava$s (Łoṃ$) endowed with long nasalisation (Łbindu$). I have heard about the conflicts between the gods and the demons, and learnt, by your kindness, about the miracle that is produced by sleep. 

[0;33;40m24.2
Now, I would like to hear about the breadth and length of the three worlds, O Brahmin. Where are the hells and the Pātāla located, O excellent Brahmin. 

[0;33;40m24.3
And I want [to learn about] the seven islands and the seven oceans. And teach me about the peak of Mount Meru, O best of Brahmins, the abode of the gods. 

[0;33;40m24.4
Vaiśampāyana spoke: Hear about, O king, the breadth and length of the three worlds. The first [level of the universe], beneath everything, is to be known as the fire of [the end of] time (kālāgni), O king of the people. 

[0;33;40m24.5
Above that, O best of kings, are the divisions of hell to be found. They start with Raurava and end with Avīcī, and they are called the places of torment. 

[0;33;40m24.6
Above them are the Pātālas, which are exactly seven in number. The first is Ābhāsatāla, the next one is Svatāla, 

[0;33;40m24.7
[then] Śītala, Gabhasti, Śarkara and Śilātala. The seventh is Mahātāla, the abode of the serpent Śeṣa, 

[0;33;40m24.8
[and also of] Bali the Daitya prince and Viśaṃkhaṇa[?] the Rākṣasa. These and all the other Nāgas, Dānavas and Rākṣasas [live in the seven Pātālas]. 

[0;33;40m24.9
Then one should learn about the seven islands, which are surrounded by seven oceans. Ten sons of kingly heroism were born to Priyavrata [Manu's son]: 

[0;33;40m24.10
Agnīdhra, Agnibāhu, Medhas, Medhātithi, Vasu, Jyotiṣmat, Dyutimat, Havya, Savana, and Patra. 

[0;33;40m24.11
The three men Agnibāhu, Medhas and Patra resorted to the path of liberation out of their fear of transmigration (saṃsāra). 

[0;33;40m24.12
Priyavrata consecrated Agnidhra [as king of] the first island [Jambudvīpa], and named Medhātithi to be `King of Plakṣadvīpa'. 

[0;33;40m24.13
Vasu was consecrated as king in Śālmalīdvīpa. He [Priyavrata] consecrated Jyotiṣmat as king in Kuśadvīpa, 

[0;33;40m24.14
and made Dyutimat the king of Krauñcadvīpa, O king, Havya the king of Śākadvīpa and Savana is said to have been [the king] in Puṣkara[dvīpa]. 

[0;33;40m24.15
On the island of Puṣkara, there is a mountain called Mānasottara. There are ... Lokapālas there ... 

[0;33;40m24.16
There is Mahāvīta country there, and Dhātaki[n?], O king! Outside of [Puṣkaradvīpa], an ocean called Sweet-water (svādudaka) emerged. 

[0;33;40m24.17
[The extension of this ocean is] 64 lakh yojanas, O king! Within the Puṣkara island, there is an ocean called the Ocean of milk (kṣīroda). 

[0;33;40m24.18
[Its extension is] 32 [yojanas] and it is located around[?] the Śāka island. Jalada, Kumāra, Sukumāra, Maṇīcaka, 

[0;33;40m24.19
Kusuma, Uttaramoda, and Mahādruma are the seven sons of Havya, and the country names [in Śākadvīpa] are the same. 

[0;33;40m24.20
At the [inner] shores of the island, one should point out a half-whey, half-milk ocean. On the seashore of Krauñcadvīpa, these are the seven countries: 

[0;33;40m24.21
Kuśala, Manonuga, Uṣṇa, Yāvana, Andhakāraka, Muni, and Dundubhi, and [these are also the names of] Dyutimat's sons. 

[0;33;40m24.22
An ocean of half curd, half-scum-of-melted-butter is around the Kuśa island. Hear also the seven counties that are located there by name, O Bhārata! 

[0;33;40m24.23
Udbhimat?, Dhenumat, Svairanna (/Svairatha), Ālambana, Dhṛti, the sixth is Prabhākara, and the seventh Kapila. 

[0;33;40m24.24
... the Ocean of alcohol (madirodadhi). around[!] Śālmalīdvīpa[, where] there are said to be seven countries: 

[0;33;40m24.25
Śveta, Harita, Jīmūta, Rohita, Vaidyuta, Mānasa, and the seventh, Suprabhaḥ. 

[0;33;40m24.26
... the Ocean of sugar-cane. Plakṣadvīpa with its seven countries is surrounded by it. 

[0;33;40m24.27
Śānta, Śiśira, Sukhada, Ānanda, Śiva, Kṣema and Dhruva: these are Medhātithi's seven sons [and the names of their countries]. 

[0;33;40m24.28
At its shores, there is the Salty ocean (lavaṇoda), which surrounds[!] Jambudvīpa. Its territory is one lakh yojanas and its contains the following minor islands: 

[0;33;40m24.29
Aṅgadvīpa, Yavadvīpa, Malayadvīpa, Śaṅkhadvīpa, Kamudvīpa[?] and Varāhadvīpa, 

[0;33;40m24.30
Siṃha, Barhiṇadvīpa, Padma, Cakra, Vajraratnākaradvīpa, Haṃsaka, Kumuda, 

[0;33;40m24.31
Lāṅgala, Vṛṣadvīpa, Bhadrākāra, Candradvīpa, Sindhu, Candanadvīpa, and so on so forth. There are said to be thousands of minor islands. 

[0;33;40m24.32
Agnīdhra consecrated [his] nine sons in nine countries. [The names of the countries/sons are:] Nābhi, Kiṃpuruṣa, Hari, Ilāvṛta, 

[0;33;40m24.36
the fifth, Ramyaka country and the sixth, Hiraṇmaya, the seventh, Kurava, the eighth Bhadrāśva, and the ninth was Ketumāla. The nine countries have been taught. South of the Himālaya, there is the country called Bhārata. Again, there emerged a ninefold division there due to Bhārata's sons: Indradvīpa, Kaśeru, Tāmravarṇa, Gabhastimat, Nāgadvīpa, Saumya, Gāndharva, Vāruṇa, and the ninth island, called Kumāradvīpa. South of Hemakūṭa[?] there is the country called Kiṃpuruṣa. 

[0;33;40m24.61
This is the extent of Bhūrloka. Above it there is Bhuvaḥ, just beyond that Svarloka, and above that Maharloka, 

[0;33;40m24.62
Janaloka, Tapoloka, and Satyaloka, in due order. Satya[loka] is said to be Brahmaloka and above it is located Viṣṇuloka. 

[0;33;40m24.63
Beyond that, the great city of divine visions is to be recognized as a thousand-story palace with gates [decorated] with cat's-eye gems and 

[0;33;40m24.64
coloured with different kinds of precious stones, inhabited by different troops of beings. That place is full of charming riches of all desires. 

[0;33;40m24.65
There, on a divine throne which is ornamented with all kinds of precious stones, the Lord Rudra is sitting, the one who wears his matted hair marked with the Moon, 

[0;33;40m24.66
the one with three eyes, chief of the three worlds, holding a trident, the ruler of the thirty [gods], together with Devī, he the illustrious one, surrounded by the Gaṇas, 

[0;33;40m24.67
with Skanda and Nandi standing in front of him, in a crowd of a hundred lakh of Gaṇas, embellished with many beautiful Rudra girls. 

[0;33;40m24.68
There are seven sacred and divine rivers there that drive away all sins, with golden sandbanks, embellished with gems for rocks: 

[0;33;40m24.69
Pāvanī, Vareṇyā, Varārhā, Varadā, Varā, Vareśā, and Varabhadrā. The waters of these auspicious rivers are crystal clear. 

[0;33;40m24.70
There are gardens with numerous flowers, and trees with gems for flowers and fruits, with fences made of different kinds of precious stones. They are ten thousand (Łayuta$) Łyojana$s in extent. 

[0;33;40m24.71
People there rejoice delighting in non-violence and truthfulness, avoiding lust and anger, constantly practising yogic meditation. 

[0;33;40m24.72
All the cow-mothers live there, practising observances. Goloka and Śivaloka are established as being one and the same. 

[0;33;40m24.73
Now the essence has been taught with respect to the inner part[?]. What other essence shall I teach, O king? The essence of Dharma, the ocean of knowledge, has been taught, the very essence of the Purāṇas, the Vedas, and the Upaniṣads. 

[0;33;40m24.74
For as in a family, ... [there are those] dwelling inside and outside. Those who dwell inside enjoy themselves all the time, and for the outsiders, [there is always just] an abundance of pain. 

[0;33;40m24.75
Just like the inner teeth of an elephant, O king, enjoys the food all the time, O king, a ruler will fight for[?] the possession (bhoga) of [the elephant's] outer teeth [i.e. the tusk], The difference between the two, see, of a similar kind[???]. 

[0;33;40m24.76
There is nothing like donations for somebody who offers freedom from danger. There is nothing like sacrifices for him who has conquered his senses. There is nothing like wealth for him who has conquered his senses. There is nothing like Dharma[?] for him whose desires are tamed[?]. 

[0;33;40m24.78
For there are no big differences between Dharma and a-Dharma. As this sacred and superior true [sat-?] Dharma was in the past taught by Parameśvara, I too have taught it in the same form, as it is, the very essence of the Purāṇas, the Vedas and the Upaniṣads.
